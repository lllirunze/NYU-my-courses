The state will provide test kits and personal protective equipment for administering tests to every facility at no cost . <p> The nation 's first deadly coronavirus outbreak was at a Seattle-area nursing home where more than 40 people died .

Workers must practice social distancing on the job and workplaces must be cleaned and sanitized at regular intervals . <p> Employers must also educate workers on how to stay safe . <p> " " It is critical that growers and agriculture workers work together , ' ' said Joel Sacks , director of the state Department of Labor and Industries . <p> The agency has been conducting outreach programs on television , radio and social media to get the message out , Sacks said . <p> There are penalties of up to $7,000 for failure to comply , Sacks said . <p> But Inslee added that most employers are in favor of the new rules .

Some agricultural workers there are conducting wildcat strikes seeking safer working conditions and hazard pay . <p> Inslee previously released rules for employer-provided farmworker housing that allowed up to 15 people to share a dormitory-style room with bunk beds . Some advocates for workers criticized those rules as too lenient . <p> For most people , the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks . For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .	
@@84783441 <h> Health official says U.S. missed some chances to slow virus <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) -- The U.S. government was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from Europe , which helped drive the acceleration of outbreaks across the nation , a top health official said Friday . <p> Limited testing and delayed travel alerts for areas outside China contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February , said Dr. Anne Schuchat , the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> " We clearly did n't recognize the full importations that were happening , " Schuchat told The Associated Press . <p> The coronavirus was first reported late last year in China , the initial epicenter of the global pandemic . But the U.S. has since become the hardest-hit nation , with about a third of the world 's reported cases and more than a quarter of the deaths . <p> The CDC on Friday published an article , authored by Schuchat , that looked back on the U.S. response , recapping some of the major decisions and events of the last few months . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow the spread . Some public health experts saw it as important assessment by one of the nation 's most respected public health doctors . <p> The CDC is responsible for the recognition , tracking and prevention of just such a disease . But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic , with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings . <p> " The degree to which CDC 's public presence has been so diminished ... is one of the most striking and frankly puzzling aspects of the federal government 's response , " said Jason Schwartz , assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health . <p> President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision , announced on Jan. 31 , to stop entry into the U.S. of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days . That took effect Feb. 2 . China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier , and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically . <p> But in her article , Schuchat noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy and other European countries during February . The U.S. government did n't block travel from there until March 11 . <p> " The extensive travel from Europe , once Europe was having outbreaks , really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread , " she told the AP . " I think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier . " <p> She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus , nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time . <p> The article is carefully worded , but Schwartz saw it as a notable departure from the White House narrative . <p> " This report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States , " he said . <p> In the article , Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany , Georgia . The gatherings spawned many cases , and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds . <p> Asked about that during the interview , Schuchat said : " I think in retrospect , taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification ( of the U.S. outbreak ) , or delayed the speed of it . " <p> But she also noted there was an evolving public understanding of just how bad things were , as well as a change in what kind of measures -- including stay-at-home orders -- people were willing to accept . <p> " I think that people 's willingness to accept the mitigation is unfortunately greater once they see the harm the virus can do , " she said . " There will be debates about should we have started much sooner , or did we go too far too fast . " <p> Schuchat 's article still leaves a lot of questions unanswered , said Dr. Howard Markel , a public health historian at the University of Michigan . <p> It does n't reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the critical period before U.S. cases began to take off in late February , he said . <p> " I want to know ... the conversations , the memos the presidential edicts , " said Markel , who 's written history books on past pandemics .

" Senior management has been working diligently to address issues as they evolve to evaluate and focus on the safety of our staff and residents . In the short term , we 're ramping up our business continuity efforts and continuing business as usual . " <p> Speaking to MidlandToday Tuesday , Mayor Ted Walker said the township does n't plan to follow neighbouring Tiny Township 's lead and declare a state of emergency . <p> Walker said that sometimes an emergency is declared so a municipality can avail of some provincial grants , such as the disaster relief fund . <p> " But in this case , it 's not necessary for us to declare emergency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or province , " he said . " In our case , it would be more on a service level where we had a shortage of staff or something and certain services have to be reduced . " <p> The municipality has informed the province about revenue losses with the provincial government indicating that it will be reviewing the situation with the federal government , as well as the possibility of using the disaster relief fund to help municipalities recoup lost revenue . <p> Barron , meanwhile , noted during the special council meeting that the township may decide to add another barrier between the public and staff . <p> " It 's valuable even in the regular flu season . We will no longer accept cash from next week . It 's a germ carrier . Our frontline staff have decided they want to wear gloves as an added precaution .

@@31620441 <h> Tailor-made vaccines could almost halve rates of serious bacterial disease <p> New research has found that rates of disease caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae could be substantially reduced by changing our approach to vaccination . Researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute , Simon Fraser University in Canada and Imperial College London combined genomic data , models of bacterial evolution and predictive modelling to identify how vaccines could be optimised for specific age groups , geographic regions and communities of bacteria . <p> The study , published today ( 3 February ) in Nature Microbiology , simulated the performance of vaccines over time to assess the risk of vaccine-targeted strains being replaced by other potentially dangerous strains . Through this predictive modelling approach , the researchers identified new vaccine designs that could help reduce overall rates of disease . <p> S. pneumoniae is often found at the back of the nasal cavity , where it is normally harmless . But when it migrates to other parts of the body , it can cause serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia , sepsis and meningitis - known collectively as invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) . IPD was estimated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of widespread vaccination , with higher rates of disease in many low- or middle- income countries* . Infants and the elderly are most at risk . <p> Vaccines against pneumococcus have prevented millions of infections . But like many bacteria , S. pneumoniae is difficult to target with vaccines because infection can be caused by different serotypes** . Each part of a vaccine usually protects against a single serotype , with the most complex pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) targeting 13 serotypes . <p> Because there are approximately 100 S. pneumoniae serotypes around the world , vaccine effectiveness varies between countries depending on which serotypes are present . When serotypes are removed from circulation by a particular vaccine , other serotypes of S. pneumoniae rise to take their place . <p> In this study , researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute , Simon Fraser University and Imperial College London optimised a computer model to approximate the effect of vaccines targeting different serotype combinations . Analysis of vaccine effectiveness was then carried out on S. pneumoniae genomic data from Massachusetts , USA and the Maela refugee camp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many designs are possible , each with different effects on disease . In Maela , for example , the presence of 64 S. pneumoniae serotypes means around 100 trillion vaccine designs are possible . But it would take 19,000 years to simulate them all , with most being sub-optimal . The researchers developed a more efficient method that made it feasible to identify the best-performing designs from the trillions of possibilities . <p> The team discovered that rates of infant IPD in Maela could actually be reduced by omitting components from the PCV13 vaccine to keep certain serotypes in place , removing the possibility of their replacement by highly-invasive serotypes . In Massachusetts , a vaccine targeting 20 serotypes was found to be more effective than the current PCV13 . <p> The results highlight the need for vaccine programmes to be tailored to specific communities of bacteria and to consider vaccination at different ages . <p> Dr Nicholas Croucher , of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis , Imperial College London , said : " Our research shows that the best vaccine designs strongly depend on the bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . The best vaccine designs also depend on the age group being vaccinated . These ideas will be critical for applying lessons learned from introducing vaccines in high-income countries to combatting the disease where the burden is highest .

Clear example of how anti-money laundering provisions are working and what is at risk for lawyers facilitating illegal transfer of trust monies and property .

Difficult enough with a 16 page disclosure statement and that was just to deposit funds clearly from the sale of a house ; imagine the difficulty if the trust was to purchase a property with some beneficiaries living overseas and the FBB .

Evon Benson-Idahosa <p> On February 28th , Nigeria , Africa 's most populous nation , confirmed its index case of the corona virus which arrived the country via an Italian businessman . As I write , her Centre for Disease Control is reporting a total of 135 confirmed cases and two deaths , having conducted just several hundred tests , even though thousands of passengers have arrived from varying countries since the index . Self isolation has been deemed an advisory , not mandatory measure . <p> by R. Evon Benson-Idahosa , EsqMar 31 , 2020 <p> R. Evon Benson-Idahosa , Esq <p> I remember falling asleep at a Tuesday evening church service as a 9 year old child . I had a tambourine on my lap and as I fell to the floor , it reverberated thunderously throughout the hall , drawing the attention of everyone who had been attentively listening to the dynamic preacherman . I awakened to piercing stares and side eyes- particularly from my father- whose message I had disrupted . Every Nigerian child knows that stare , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in debilitating fear and assures your quivering being that there will be consequences . Needless to say , it was a quiet ride home and for the rest of the revival week , I was ushered to the front row where I forced my eyes open , humming tunes to myself to stay awake . <p> Me , circa 1984 , in my choir uniform and what was possibly the now infamous tambourine . <p> Saying that I literally grew up in church would be an understatement . Week long revival services , such as the one I reference above , were customary . I was also in the choir , went to Sunday school before church services on Sunday , Agape Force Children 's meetings on Saturdays , mid-week services and the occasional 6:30 am morning prayer services , followed by our home bible study with Auntie B. And because my father was Archbishop Benson Idahosa , there were no negotiations . It just was . <p> At the age of10 , shortly after the infamous " tambourine experience , " the truth of those messages became real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , as news began to sweep the globe of the novel corona virus and its import , I found myself immediately turning to my faith as a source of comfort and peace . I also called my mother , who now heads CGMI , the global ministry my father left when he passed away 22 years ago . Her words of encouragement and the tone of her voice assured me that , as we like to say in Nigeria , ' it is well . ' <p> And it will be . <p> But for now , the pandemic continues to rage , as thousands succumb to its will . First China . Then South Korea . Japan . An epidemic . Then Italy , the UK , the US . Thousands upon thousands of cases were being reported and every day brought the reality closer to home . Then it became a global pandemic and as it stands , the WHO estimates that there are 719,700 confirmed cases globally , with almost 34,000 deaths . <p> On February 28th , Nigeria , Africa 's most populous nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country via an Italian businessman . As I write , her Centre for Disease Control is reporting a total of 135 confirmed cases and two deaths , having conducted just several hundred tests , even though thousands of passengers have arrived from varying countries since the index . Self isolation has been deemed an advisory , not mandatory measure . <p> Four new cases of #COVID19 have been reported in Nigeria ; 3 in Osun and 1 in Ogun <p> Nigeria has taken what some would consider drastic , yet in this writer 's opinion , insufficient and strikingly Western style measures to address what is likely to come in the absence of a miracle . In addition to finally closing her borders from international travelers , including Nigerians , schools have been shut down , civil servants are being asked to work from home , " social distancing " policies are being enacted and several states , including my home state of Edo , have prohibited religious , social and public gatherings of more than 20 persons . <p> In a country where over 90% of her citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to their faith in times of crisis . The corona virus pandemic is no exception . Many who had strayed from God are now repenting of their sins and brandishing the sign of the cross as they leave their homes . Others are praying for a " Passover , " as CNN and other news outlets flood us with " end of the world , " doomsday messaging . As a result , many of us are yearning to collectively gather to pray . <p> Whether the desire to collectively gather is buttressed by denial ( " coronavirus is not here " -- " the spirit of corona virus is dead in Nigeria " ) or stems from a deep seeded longing for God to show mercy to a healthcare system that is wholly unprepared to handle the worst case scenario , the fact remains that Nigeria 's religious faithfuls are unaccustomed to missing gatherings for anything . Services are considered sacred times to commune with God and to be encouraged by the brethren . Others hang on to every word of their clerics who , in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their congregants and God . Many believers who engage with God on a transactional basis come bearing tithes and/or offerings in the hopes that God will hear their prayers . ( He hears them regardless . ) <p> As such , the prohibition on religious gatherings of more than 20 ( which essentially translates to a prohibition of services in general ) has resulted in many Nigerian believers losing their ' religion , ' i.e. , left bewildered as to how to make the adjustment to a God who potentially exists outside the four walls of their churches ; to a God who speaks directly to them in God 's long forgotten voice . Who , precisely , are Nigerian believers without our religions and religious houses of worship ? <p> Could it be that for the first time in a long time , Nigerian believers are being presented with a church-less opportunity to develop even more meaningful personal relationships with their God ; to ' lay hands ' on themselves and speak words of healing into their children from a God who has always heard them ? Could this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Bowen describes as a ' non-anxious presence ' to those who may be paralyzed by fear ? Or as a practical example , to give our hired staff the much deserved paid time off to assuage the fears of their own elderly parents ? As we creatively consider our individual responses , it is imperative that we recognise that our actions are a reflection of what we truly believe about our faith and the One who implores us to be salt and light . <p> As the Church , however , it is unhelpful that some of our pastors are refusing to comply . The other day , I was tagged on a rather unfortunate video of a pastor irresponsibly screaming to congregants that the corona virus can not withstand Nigeria 's " corrosive anointing . " However , even Jesus instructed us to obey the law of the land ( render unto Caesar what is Caesar 's ) . This blatant refusal to consider the reality that may most aggressively affect those on the margins begs the question of why some churches are so adamant against temporarily closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encouragement in these perilous and uncertain times , but have we not , after all these years , fed the flock enough " meat " to trust that they can and will turn to God for themselves ? Or are we , draped in our own egos , more selfishly concerned that they may not return to our fold and thus , affect our financial bottom line ? <p> It is not a lack of faith to use wisdom or to be practical . Even Jesus reached out his hand to save Peter when he could easily have let him drown and then used his " corrosive anointing " to raise him from the dead . Wisdom is profitable to direct and I believe my father , who I consider one of the greatest men of faith to ever walk this earth , would have done the needful to protect the sheep . My mother most certainly is . <p> To this end , some larger churches are offering their services online . However , for the working poor who faithfully make up the backbone of most Nigerian churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that option impractical and/or unaffordable . They are the ones , who because they live day to day , can not afford to practice social distancing , " stay at home " and for some , even " wash your hands , " because soap becomes a luxury when one 's ' daily bread ' is devoid of the ' daily . ' If our government does not step up to courageously seek support that is tailored to our unique realities and then provide that support to those on the margins , the import of the corona virus in our beloved Nigeria could be felt by generations to come . <p> As such , could this pandemic present an opportunity for churches to fill the glaring gaps and practically serve the last and the least in a manner that reveals who we profess to be as followers of The Way ? Might this be an opportunity for the church to put our egos aside and creatively heed Jesus ' instructions to ' feed my sheep ' , to apply the Balm of Gilead , by serving those who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , could we convert our sanctuaries to temporary hospitals or food pantries where those in need can obtain essentials ? Can we use the funds of those who have faithfully donated over the years to buy ventilators and personal protective gear for our hospitals and health workers on the front lines ? Can we purchase hygiene products and distribute them to those who may be confined to their homes ? This , I believe , is our mandate . <p> At the end of the day , my faith in God runs deep . It has guided my life since I was 10 and I prayerfully trust that we will get through this . But as the Nigerian Church temporarily loses her ' religion ' and her faith is unveiled in the face of COVID-19 , she is presented with an opportunity to reverberate thunderously and rise up to be who she professes for such a novel time as this .

@@71934841 <p> This week is going to be ugly . There 's no getting around that . Every negotiation starts at opposite ends of a spectrum , and the chasm between Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association is wide enough that as they navigate a return-to-play agreement to set the stage for the return of professional team sports in America , a fight is almost guaranteed . <p> Where these discussions go , and how the principals involved steer them , mark the most consequential moment for the sport since it barely averted a work stoppage in 2002 . The coronavirus pandemic is altering the world . Unemployment is historically high . The future is impossible to forecast . And Monday , as MLB owners rubber-stamped the league 's proposal that it intends to share with the union in a meeting Tuesday , the conversation focused on money . <p> What followed surprised no one . This is not how it had to go , but it was how it was always going to go , millionaires and billionaires pitted against one another in a game of chicken . Stake out a position . Refuse to budge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ticking clock forces its abandonment . When that happens , when the posturing abates , the ugliness will burn off like the morning fog and there will be hope for a deal -- for baseball . <h> Most hyped prospect ever for every team <p> Bryce Harper , Ken Griffey Jr . and Bo Jackson lived up to their billing . Todd Van Poppel and Gregg Jefferies ? Not so much . Here 's the one prospect we were sure would be your team 's next superstar.David Schoenfield <p> As the sport with the clearest path and greatest appetite to return , baseball has an opportunity to illustrate the importance of equitable , shared sacrifice , to be a model of togetherness amid division . All of that , of course , is merely talk -- admittedly naive , unquestionably hopeful , ignoring what 's of greater import than rich people being a little less rich : that if baseball does relaunch , it does so with the health and safety of players , managers , coaches and all those in its orbit in mind . That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , is neither words nor bluster . It needs substance , foresight , action . And over the next two weeks , as the season hangs in the balance , action there will be . It 's up to the leaders of both sides to decide what sort . <p> What is in the return-to-play proposal ? <p> In broad terms : <p> * A 50-50 split of revenue from the 2020 season <p> * An 82-game schedule instead of the standard 162 <p> * A mid-June " spring training " and early-July Opening Day <p> * A 14-team postseason rather than the typical 10 <p> * Games played in home stadiums where allowed <p> * Designated hitters in the American and National League <p> * Games against only divisional and regional opponents -- i.e. , AL West teams , for example , play AL West and NL West teams <p> * Expanded rosters from 26 to as many as 30 active players with a 20-man taxi squad of minor league players and prospects <p> There are certainly more details to the proposal , including vital ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize this is an initial proposal that serves as a starting point for any return-to-play scenario and will necessitate a rigorous back-and-forth with amendments galore before it satisfies both parties . <p> What was the players ' reaction to it ? <p> Was it that stupid a question ? <p> Yes . <p> Why ? <p> Because the first item -- the 50-50 revenue split -- is a non-starter for the players . <p> Before explaining , it 's essential to understand how revenue works in baseball . The NFL , NBA and NHL all have revenue splits . They also operate in salary-capped systems . Straight revenue splits , in which sport-related income is pooled and distributed according to formulas agreed upon in collective bargaining negotiations , historically have been the domain of capped systems . MLB operates with no salary cap . <p> In baseball , there are two streams of revenue : local and national . Local revenue includes television contracts , which range from around $20 million a year ( Miami Marlins ) to upward of $250 million ( Los Angeles Dodgers ) , and in-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets , concessions and other gate-related income . Nearly half of local net revenue is pooled and shared . National revenue comes from television contracts for the postseason and games of the week , league-owned media entities ( MLB Advanced Media and MLB Network ) , licensing , merchandising and corporate sponsorships . All national revenue is shared equally . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> The pandemic has turned off the revenue spigot . Whether local revenue accounts for 40% of teams ' incoming cash or a cut in the 30s , as past reports have suggested , the prospect of going a full season without fans -- and potentially going fan-free , or at least fan-light , into the 2021 season -- is daunting for teams ' bottom lines . Because all 30 teams ' revenue streams differ , it is realistic to believe some teams will lose money playing games without fans this season . Already , multiple teams are planning layoffs or furloughs starting June 1 , according to sources . <p> Owners are looking to cut costs wherever they can -- and nothing costs more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March agreed to pay players on a prorated basis -- at 82 games , they would receive 50.6% of their expected 2020 salaries -- the owners believe that language in that agreement allows them to renegotiate player wages in the event of games with no fans in the stands . The players vehemently disagree . ( More on that later . ) <p> How bad for the players would a split actually be ? <p> Warning : This is going to be some very back-of-the-napkin math that attempts to estimate revenues . Ballparking revenues tends to be a fool 's errand . In short , a 50-50 split is a huge issue . But indulge me . It is more to make a point . <p> Forbes estimated that MLB 's industrywide revenues in 2019 were $10.7 billion . Club sources have suggested the number was lower but in that ballpark . Let 's use the higher number but use teams ' estimate that 40% of local revenue will vanish without ticket sales . That leaves $6.4 billion . <h> Would a baseball card lie ? <p> Sources have estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2.5 billion range annually . Because teams under this plan would play only half the games , that 's half the revenue -- say , another $1.2 billion haircut . And that does not account for regional sports networks , which pay local TV-rights fees , potentially asking for a discount based on the difference in the product , whether it 's because there are no fans in the stands or because teams are forced to play away from home thanks to local government regulations . Ignoring that possibility , we 're down to $5.2 billion . <p> National TV money is estimated at $1.7 billion a year . The point of implementing expanded playoffs would be to maintain that number , with the loss of half the Sunday Night Baseball games and the expected cancellation of the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby in Los Angeles . In the current system , MLB 's guaranteed number of playoff games is 26 , and its maximum is 43 . Expanded playoffs would swell those numbers to 36 and 59 . That translates to hundreds of millions of extra dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low-$5 billion range . <p> Losses in other areas are almost a given , dropping revenue under $5 billion . Which , admittedly , still seems high , especially if owners are claiming they could lose money this year . Still , it makes the prospect of a 50-50 split with players interesting financially . Player salaries for 2020 are estimated somewhere between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion . Let 's go with $4.3 billion . At a prorated salary for 50.6% of the games , that 's around $2.18 billion . Half of , say , $4.8 billion would be $2.4 billion . <p> play <p> 1:43 <h> Why MLB players should accept proposal for shortened season <p> Mark Teixeira and Jeff Passan weigh in on the impending decision by the MLBPA on a proposed shortened 2020 season with a 50-50 revenue split between players and owners . <p> Could players really be guaranteed more money in a 50-50 split ? <p> It 's possible , sources said , but looking at it strictly from a revenue perspective ignores three issues critical to the union . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system frightens players , even if this proposal does n't involve a salary ceiling or any other cap tenets . The mistrust between the sides has deepened in recent years -- just look at their different interpretations of that March agreement , which is barely six weeks old -- and the slightest whiff of a cap sends off Pandora 's box signals at the union . <p> 2 . Salaries do not grow commensurate with revenue gains . So now , in a year in which the game is struggling , it 's necessary for the players to share in the losses ? That 's not how it works . <p> 3 . If a second wave of the coronavirus were to strike before or during the postseason and force the cancellation of games , postseason TV money would vanish . Even if the estimated revenues were $5 billion , they would crater with the cancellation of playoff money and leave the players with less than their prorated share . <p> To really understand what the players think about the revenue-split idea , one needed only hear what MLBPA executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that restricts player pay based on revenues is a salary cap , period . This is not the first salary-cap proposal our union has received . It probably wo n't be the last . That the league is trying to take advantage of a global health crisis to get what they 've failed to achieve in the past -- and to anonymously negotiate through the media for the last several days -- suggests they know exactly how this will be received . None of this is beneficial to the process of finding a way for us to safely get back on the field and resume the 2020 season -- which continues to be our sole focus . " <p> Damn . <p> Yeah . MLB commissioner Rob Manfred had to expect some sort of response to the 50-50 split , but that was a response . <p> So say all the " Kumbaya " pabulum you were spouting earlier about peace and love and harmony does n't come to fruition because the impediment of money is intractable . What 's the worst-case scenario here ? <p> No season at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Turn back the clock 26 years , to 1994 , when MLB wanted to institute a salary cap .

Baseball lost a World Series because the league sought a salary cap and the players refused to budge . <p> Since then , baseball has seen 25 years of labor peace , the most since the union was founded in 1966 . <p> Hold on . You 're seriously saying they 'd lose a season over this ? <p> They could . In fact , for argument 's sake , let 's assume they do . What are the outcomes for each side ? <p> Players : <p> * They do n't get paid beyond the lump sum of $170 million negotiated in the March deal , a problematic issue for the surprising number of players who live paycheck to paycheck . <p> * They lose a year of playing , an item of immense value for those who understand baseball is a profession with a short career span . <p> * The free-agent market after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may dip into savings reserved for an emergency -- such as a potential work stoppage after the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2021 season . <p> * Agents , on whom players lean for counsel , do n't receive commissions -- and some accordingly are threatened with insolvency . <p> Owners : <p> * Their revenues shrivel to almost nothing . <p> * Mass firings and furloughs take place . <p> * Multiple bankruptcies are possible , if not likely , either prompting bailouts from MLB or forcing owners to sell . <p> * Franchise values , which have skyrocketed in recent years , plummet , because recovery from the financial hole created by a lost 2020 season could take years . <p> Whose outcome is worse ? <p> I 'm the one who asks the questions . <p> Sorry . <p> Whose outcome is worse ? <p> They are both absolutely terrible !

Owners tend to be in the game long term , and the recovery of the economy could eventually make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firings , furloughs , bankruptcies and plummeting values are like the Four Horsemen of the financial apocalypse . <h> MLB 's great debates <p> Is the Astros ' title forever tainted ? Is Jeter overrated ? We offer the final word on every team 's most burning question . Story <p> There is a principle of negotiation called BATNA -- best alternative to a negotiated agreement . When one side 's BATNA is better than the other 's , that side gains a significant advantage . If there is an advantage here , it 's not very big . Both sides ' alternatives feel positively ruinous . <p> And that 's not even taking into account the missed-opportunity cost of being the only team sport back during a time when fans are craving something to watch , as well as the narrative that would lay waste to the sport 's reputation and haunt it if money did , in fact , scuttle a season . <p> Major League Baseball : The sport that shut down during a global pandemic because it could n't figure out how to split up billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For one , union lawyers believe they 're in the right legally when it comes to guaranteeing players ' prorated salary . The March agreement contains a Player Compensation and Benefit section that does not specifically address a reduction in salary if games are played in front of no fans . <p> That said , on Page 1 of the agreement , the first point of the Resumption of Play section includes the words : " ( T ) he 2020 championship season shall not be commenced unless and until each of the following conditions is satisfied . " One of those conditions ends with : " ( T ) he Office of the Commissioner and Players Association will discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate substitute neutral sites . " <p> The first sentence of the compensation section begins with the clause : " If and when the conditions exist for the commencement of the 2020 championship season ... " -- language similar to that on the first page . <p> When asked by ESPN to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither MLB nor the union adopted different positions . Two said the similarity in the language made it clear that those sections were meant to be tied together . One agreed with the union 's interpretation that anything about compensation changing should have been written explicitly . The fourth called any potential grievance on the matter a toss-up . <h> MLB 's biggest one-hit wonders <p> For a single season , these players raised their game to levels they had never achieved before -- or would again . <p> Beyond the legal question , there is the matter of how it has been presented to players . Union leadership has been vociferous in saying players would be paid their full prorated salaries . Part of this could be strategic -- as a rallying point that a group of 1,200 players of different ages , races and homelands with differences in opinion will not be exploited by 30 billionaires . <p> The tack does come with hazards . Promising something like full prorated salaries takes away a potential negotiating chip . If Clark cedes any money to ownership , he runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is incentivized not to give up money , even though it 's clear that money is an imperative part of any deal . <p> Do the players have an argument for their full salaries that goes beyond the legal interpretation of the March agreement ? <p> Absolutely . They 're the ones who actually have to go out and work during a pandemic . Which is not to compare them to those who toil in hospitals or nursing homes or grocery stores . But it is to compare them to ... owners . Who most certainly do not have to travel on planes , stay in hotels or simply leave their homes . <p> How big of an issue is health and safety ? <p> It 's difficult to tell . If the players wanted to stay away from the compensation issue publicly and focus on health and safety altogether , it would be the easiest messaging win imaginable : " We want to play baseball , and we want to do so in the healthiest and safest way possible to protect our families , our more at-risk co-workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect playbook for this approach on Twitter after the details of MLB 's proposal surfaced . <h> ' Opening Day ' Power Rankings <p> Sure , the baseball season is in limbo , but that does n't mean we ca n't have Power Rankings . How does your team stack up ? Power Rankings <p> He asked about the frequency of testing and how non-players would be protected and whether there would be modifications to clubhouses . Any agreement , he said , needs " a proactive health plan focused on prevention and reactive plan aimed at containment . " Even though Doolittle , as a healthy 33-year-old , is not among those COVID-19 typically afflicts , his wife , Eireann Dolan , has asthma . As Doolittle said : " We need to consider what level of risk we 're willing to assume . " <p> For example : How do you deal with players who say they 're not interested in playing , whether because of preexisting conditions or family members whose health makes them more susceptible to COVID-19 or , very simply , because they are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of infection ? <p> In addition to the actual health concerns , moral authority is up for grabs . If one side is the billionaires who want to save money and the other is the players who want to ensure that their families , older employees , outside workers and they themselves are as insulated from the coronavirus as possible , well , even the most dyed-in the-wool corporatist might have trouble maligning the players for focusing on that . If the sides ca n't come to an agreement , it 's an awfully hard sell for the league to suggest it did n't happen because ... the players wanted too much testing ? <p> It 's fairly clear what the league wants . How about the union ? <p> Fact is , the union members want their money too , and Clark saying as much did n't exactly bolster their ability to ride a health-and-safety platform . <p> Every year , MLB provides some financial information to the union . But in this case , with revenues so opaque , a clearer picture would give the players confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considering how closely the league holds its finances , a robust audit would represent the sort of olive branch that could bring the sides together . <p> In terms of potential concessions , there are plenty . Service time remains a bugaboo . So does competitive balance . Maybe a change to free agency to encourage spending at a time when teams might be disincentivized to pursue players . The players could ask for more games so their prorated salary is higher . MLB 's proposal has most of the postseason in October , seemingly as a hedge against a potential second wave . The players could push for the playoffs to go deeper into November . <p> So are owners going to yield ? <p> Well , most of them did n't become billionaires by accident . Unless they have evolved overnight , they will push and cajole and hold out for the best deal , knowing that in the end , fans often side with teams over players . They can say that they 're losing money and want their workers ' salaries to reflect that , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if players already agreed in the March deal to a structure that will halve their salaries . <p> Then again , a truth underpins this entire negotiation : If ever there were a time for billionaire owners to do good -- not in paying players , per se , but in avoiding the catastrophic fallout of baseball adding to a national unemployment rate approaching 15% -- it 's now . And if ever there were a time for millionaire players to shed cynicism and adopt not a mien of war but one of mutually beneficial deal-making , it 's now . <p> You 're being naive and hopeful again . <p> Pretty much . <p> What 's the solution ? <p> For starters , maybe make Tuesday 's meeting not about a 50-50 split or any finances . Try to answer Doolittle 's questions and those posed thus far by other players . To emphasize the plan about how to restart a sport in the middle of a pandemic . The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon , and the sides could spend hours talking without mentioning dollars and cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning of the morning fog is simply necessary . Get the wrong out of the way so a right can come of it . Or something like that . <p> There is no easy solution here . The pandemic can bring out the worst in baseball , expose all of its fragilities , if Manfred and Clark are n't careful . <p> So , uh , that solution ? <p> Oh yeah . Well , if cash-flow problems are that real for owners , players could defer a portion of their salaries with interest . While that does add debt that all 30 teams are trying to avoid , it would solve a short-term issue while showing a willingness to compromise . Yes , a deferral is technically a pay cut -- it is cutting pay now -- but remember : equitable , shared sacrifice . <p> As for owners , they can give service time more than lip service and stop the farcical manipulation they 've used as a tool to keep players from free agency for years . They can put levers in place to ensure free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . They can raise the minimum salary next year leading into the negotiations on a new agreement . <p> These are smart people . If they want , they can find a deal . They just have to be willing to look for it . <p> What comes after that ? <p> The league figures out how many governors are on board with the idea of empty-stadium baseball returning in their state -- and , less comfortably , of teams from their geographical area of the country coming into town to visit . Manfred , sources told ESPN , has called governors around the country to lobby for MLB 's return in home stadiums . Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine and Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan both told ESPN they have spoken with Manfred but declined to characterize their conversations . <h> Arenado : ' I miss baseball every day ' <p> The Rockies star shares what his game days were like , but how he has to spend them now during a pandemic . Story ? <p> Also on the list : a blessing from the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Fauci telling The New York Times that he planned Tuesday to offer criticism for the country reopening too early , it 's clear that MLB could find itself facing similar disparagement . Nobody ever said coming back was supposed to be easy . For a business the size of MLB 's , with such a public profile , the standard will be higher -- and warranted . <p> That 's a lot to do in not a lot of time to do it , right ? <p> It 's not great , Bob . <p> How long do they have ? <p> Four sources landed on the same time frame : about 2 ? weeks , with a chance for a resolution -- good or bad -- sooner but not much later . In 15 days or so , May will be winding down , and figuring out the logistics of getting twice the normal-sized team 's worth of players to one location takes time . <p> Players want three-plus weeks to get ready , and if baseball is to begin on the Fourth of July -- ' Merica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's squeezing a lot of stuff into not a lot of time . <p> Ugh . Is baseball just falling apart ? <p> No . Not yet . Remember , Tuesday 's meeting is the first to discuss the proposal . There are many more conversations to be had , ideas to be shared , bargains to reach . Any potential deal will go through iteration after iteration . A lot can get accomplished in 2 ? weeks . <p> Yes or no : Does a deal get done ? <p> I go back to the BATNA , and I think yes . <p> I go back to the strike , and I think the BATNA does n't mean anything . <p> The hope is that MLB learned its lesson from 1994 . The truth is that we wo n't know until a deal is struck or it all falls apart . <p> So here 's a little advice . Do n't get too hung up on this week . It 's easy to be a prisoner of the moment , to get high when it looks like baseball is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to money . This is the beginning , and the beginning can be complicated and tumultuous and not particularly reflective of the actual state of play . <p> That 's coming soon enough .

But still , bad news is even worse news two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> National will be able to dig right in with its tried and tested attack line that " the left " ca n't manage the economy . <p> Its pre-coronavirus focus on supporting small to medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) with fewer minimum wage rises and less red tape for example , will also get a platform , as SMEs risk being disproportionately affected by an economic downturn . <p> National on Thursday came out suggesting the Government gives coronavirus-affected SMEs wage subsidies like those it provided after the Canterbury and Kaikoura earthquakes . <p> After the Kaikoura quake for example , sole traders and SMEs who could n't operate or had to operate at a reduced capacity could receive up to $500 a week for full-time employees and $300 a week for part-timers for up to eight weeks . <p> National 's approach earlier in the week was to say the Government would be better placed to respond to coronavirus had it maintained higher rates of GDP growth - a flimsy argument . <p> Its tactic seemed even more misguided when it said its proposed ( but yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stimulate the economy in the face of coronavirus , even though this would n't be a direct fiscal emergency response and would n't help those without an income - perhaps due to coronavirus . <p> The trouble National faces is that going to town , criticising the Government 's response to coronavirus , particularly on the health front , risks being perceived as unproductive and even destructive . <p> If it erodes public confidence in authorities to the point this creates panic ( it has already been accused of encouraging panic shopping ) it 'll be slammed for putting its political interests ahead of the country 's . <p> National needs the firing range to be cleared of coronavirus , so it can take clean shots at the Government for breaking key promises on KiwiBuild and Auckland light rail , and in some instances , letting ideology rather than evidence drive policy . Pre-coronavirus it was starting to gather momentum and do a good job of this . <p> Coronavirus is now giving some under-performing government ministers a ' get out of jail free ' card . <p> Greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZ First will struggle as much as National to get airtime to differentiate themselves from the Coalition Government to solidify their support bases . <p> With National polling strongly and NZ First below 5% , it 's in Labour 's interest for NZ First to reconnect with its voters . <p> But the view expressedin February that neither minor party can go so far as to making the Coalition Government look dysfunctional to the point it 's unelectable , rings even more true as the country needs a united government to lead us through an epidemic . <p> Election 2020 was always expected to follow the international trend and be fought on the personalities of party leaders . Coronavirus will only exacerbate this . <p> The more people tune in to Ardern delivering both bad news and messages of hope on their screens , the more they 'll be thinking , " Would I prefer to be looking at Simon Bridges right now ? " <p> If preferred prime minister poll results are anything to go by , the answer in most cases will be , no . <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody a competent government during what will be a long six months of relentless negativity . <p> We welcome your help to improve our coverage of this issue .

Our current comment policy is here . <h> 88 Comments <h> Comment Filter <p> It is of my opinion that the NZ political arena lacks acumen , regardless of which party or political colors you 've hitched your wagon to . I do n't blame the people ( who have many talents of their own ) , but really the manner in which our ruling elite 's institutions are structured . The negativity is a making of the ruling elite 's own , particularly on the economic front . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the economic profile of NZ has some serious issues . That all seems to be coming to a head now with externalities . The ruling elite , from politicians to central bankers to beauracrats and even to corporate leaders , have managed to sugar coat performance and deflect any real serious debate and action towards shortcomings . If you have read Sun Tzu 's ' The Art of War ' , it should be no surprise that they 're in this predicament . And unfortunately , the general public has been herded away from critical thought ( thank you NewsTalk ZB , etc ) so the ability to get any clarity of thought among them is seemingly impossible . <p> A technocratic approach to government ( at all levels ) is essentially about voter suppression and keeping the plebs and populists away from the levers of power . By controlling the narrative and reducing opportunities for debate , accountability and leadership is replaced with a managerial approach / rigidly defined systems and processes that prioritise protecting the politicians and technocrats over delivering the outcome ( or rather , replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same generally applies to NZ managerial approach to running businesses . <p> An obvious symptom of this is the ratio of journos to flacks in NZ , reportedly being 1-10 . Apparently PR is the highest growth area of government employment . Sugar coating is new new productivity .... <p> Sums it up entirely . Despite the freedoms that the internet has given us for expression , it has also come with something more Orwellian in terms of how we 're controlled . Case in point : How long ago were Australia and NZ labelled the ' rock star economies ' ? People suck up that self affirmation , however hollow it might be . Also notice how publications like Granny Herald publish rankings featuring NZ . This is also a tactic to convince the people how great everything is . Not to say it some of it is n't deserved and something to be proud of . But it 's more about emotional gratifcation than anything else . <p> On balance , NZ has done pretty well so far at keeping the coronavirus under control with very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 34 cases . So it 's worth taking a look at global update maps to get things in perspective and realize that we 're going much better then most . <p> No they have n't done well , we 're just lucky and expensive to get to . This new case is really poor : its taken them two days to confirm the husband of case 2 is also infected and disclose he went to the Tool concert a week ago ( anyone he infected will now likely be infectious ) . Ashley Bloomfield , our Director-General of Health , is doing minimal testing for some reason we can only speculate on . He refuses to test obvious cases despite having capacity to do so . While the media will cover for Labour , I 'm not sure they will be forgiven if they get the blame for any of these known cases becoming outbreaks in time for the election . <p> On balance at least they were able to find and test them here . Now compare that case to the US and Trumps bumblings . Trump has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test kits and the number of cases is rapidly escalating , so much so they 've had to declare a state of emergency in some states . BBC article : Coronavirus : White House concedes US lacks enough test kitshttps : **35;5205;TOOLONG ... I was in a room with 2 people today that had 2 degrees of separation from a confirmed case . I suggested we are all getting it since we are n't wuhan locked down yet and we just needed to be grateful we were not in the high risk age/health groups . <p> I 'll give you that there are n't many countries actually trying stop the coronavirus from becoming endemic ( the USA is not on this list ) , as opposed to the doing minimum required to achieve plausible deniability that they did not chose their economies over public health . But I 'll argue that we have some of the the most defensible boarders for a pandemic and according to a poll there is broad public support for further restrictions so it would make sense to pull out all the stops like Singapore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your performance against the US and Europe who never tried to stop the spread . <p> when you reach the election booth it will come down to ardern or bridges , and much like the democratic US election where it came down to anybody but sanders , folks will choose accordingly.Simo is too Sino for a lot of us . <p> Maybe not the best choice of words , sorry about that . Calling a spade a spade though . Tough times , call for a tough leader . Come on , lets call it , she has been out of depth since the start and it has just got 10 times worse . Jacinda calls for calm , public reaction panic buying . Very few have any trust in her . <p> If I thought the Nats had a decent housing policy I might consider voting for them . Not with standing J Collin 's being " ethically compromised " one is between a rock and a hard place as she is the housing spokesperson and a potential leader and wo n't be leaving parliament any time soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I call them Gnats because they 're actively selling out the country to CCP . They 're basically traitors . IF they at least showed the intent of doing something good for the country ( not just their top 1% buddies ) , I 'd show more respect . <p> ' To start with Labour , coronavirus is giving the party 's greatest asset - Jacinda Ardern - a platform to demonstrate leadership - a skill she proved her mastery of in the aftermath of the March 15 mosque terror attacks . ' <p> That proved her public leadership and empathy , certainly . But I still have plenty of misgivings about her general political leadership . The buck stops with her and her leadership , and the government has failed in many policy areas . <p> As the articial says , she 's ca n't do it herself , she needs her ministers to step up . They did n't manage to get theor house in order when we were in the good times , so in the tough going .. no chance . Helen Clark could handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that standing . <p> 6 months to go and the PM has got the ability to carry it , the campaign that is . To my my mind she is a sincere lady , a good person underneath it all . You need very thick armour to survive in the world of politics if you are of that ilk . Perhaps she will not stay on after the election , citing family and other values . Who could blame her . But the problem for Labour that will emerge is the possibility of a Labour &amp; Greens only government , which the voting public of NZ will undoubtedly see as an alarming prospect ; Labour itself too probably . For if a government is formed as such , and the Greens come full on out of left field , the nation will soon be in an uproar . Labour would bear the negativity and stigma of that for years to come . <p> I quite like the idea of a Lab Green coalition . Maybe then shit will get done re . the environment and living standards for the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing is driving inequality , eroding the kiwi egalitarian dream , and denying environmental issues to support their big business buddies , they will look to the left for leadership . <p> Hugs and headscarves are n't enough when real leadership is required . The worse the virus gets the poorer Labour 's image will become . They have already fluffed the best chance we had of keeping it out . " Too little , too late " is their mantra . <p> Or we could see a brave media peering ahead at what New Zealand is inevitably going to traverse this next decade , and have a mature public discussion about what would be best , in that light . <p> Nah - why would we do that ? Let 's pretend that growth is forever , adding words like ' good ' and ' solid ' and ' normal ' while pretending to be all-seeing . Then lets report public-opinion polls , having kept said public in the dark - a self-justifying Catch-22 . <p> Jeanette Fitzsimons got the big picture - notice the nine-to-noon front Ryan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Ryan is n't the only one to have stuff put clearly under her nose ......... <p> Limits to Growth , placement along said trajectory and what to do about it . The only game in town . How long , how long ( to mangle Kipling ) <p> @PDK I agree , we need to undertake some serious scenario planning , for a future unknown , and to be honest we have been good at long -term planning in some areas . <p> Take Fibre-to-the-door for instance , what a stroke of brilliance <p> Or the National cycleway which some asked me about in the US when I was on holiday there <p> Kiwisaver .. good example of starting to wean us off the Nanny <p> We have not planned inward immigration well , we have not planned Auckland 's growth well , and we have not spent enough on getting our roads up to 18th Century standards , but this all creates HUGE opportunity . <p> @Masher , she does not make me feel good at all ............. I cant stand her one bit , all sugary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet are a disaster <p> Twyford ............... Chief idiot and dreamer Clark .................... Hopless smiling fool ............ he should go on holiday again like he did during the Doctors strike Peters ................... Lying cheating racist Galloway .............. Asleep at the wheel , does not bother to read advisory notes and lets criminals get residence while in Jail Nash .................... Another dozy fool , gang crime out of control under his watch Hipkins ................. Unable to control the radical elements in the Teacher Unions has led to trouble in education while he cowers like a beaten dog Jones ................... Head of the Bottomless Pit Ministry , throwing endless money at run down provinces with no prospect of ever getting a return <p> What on earth , Jenee , do you imagine ' love , hope and global leadership ' mean in any political context ? These - at least the first two - are religious values . And I seriously doubt the existence of the supposed third quality attributed to Ardern . Where , would you say , you see evidence of it ? What redirection or new clarity of direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her perceived ' leadership ' ? <p> What New Zealand needs of its Prime Minister and government is not a set of admirable intangibles - things we may or may not feel - but the deliberate and measurable ability to deal with tangibles here and now . Yes , coronavirus is a very serious challenge , but it joins promises and failures in a host of areas : burst infrastructure , homelessness , poverty , an immigration shambles , taxation inequities , educational slippage , etc . Personality - and I 'm no judge of Ardern 's - does n't come into it . We need to see achievement . And , so far as coronavirus is concerned , we need to see firm direction and achievement across multiple sectors of concern urgently . <p> Crises expose the weak and reveal the strong . Right now , I would say , we do n't know which will be the certain , undeniable , actuality of this administration , when put under truly intense pressure . <p> Lol You must be living under a rock if you have n't seen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one example ' The Christchurch Call ' https : **39;5242;TOOLONG ... and here is another quote from Time Magazine " But Ardern 's deft and quietly revolutionary management of these crises , especially the Christchurch shootings , got noticed around the globe . Her gender and youth ( she 's 39 ) were always going to make her stand out in a field dominated mainly by old gray men . Those attributes , however , are just the wrapping . Ardern 's real gift is her ability to articulate a form of leadership that embodies strength and sanity , while also pushing an agenda of compassion and community -- or , as she would put it , " pragmatic idealism . " https : **39;5283;TOOLONG ... Steve1 , I 've seen and read plenty of this kind of hagiography . It 's journalism as wish-fulfillment . It leaves my questions unanswered . Where do you see evidence of such ' global leadership ' ? What redirection or new clarity of direction do you see on ' the globe ' resulting from her ' leadership ' ? These claims are easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe that has been affected in any tangible sense by Ardern 's supposed ' global leadership ' . What has changed that you can attribute to Ardern ? In Australia ? the UK ? EU ? US ? China ? SE Asia ? Africa ? the UN ? Where ? Do people around the world ' feel ' better ? Fight less ? Do things differently ? Have higher motivations ? Are they more empathetic ? Less misogynistic ? What ? I do n't dislike her . I wish her well . But I want to see some justification for such a vast abstraction as ' global leadership ' . It 's meaningless , a distraction from fact . More than this , I want to see action here in New Zealand . <p> Deft and adept sound-bite politics . That is what gets people to vote for a politician or a political party . Real policies and excellent management , well , sadly these do not win votes . <p> I especially like the headline of this article . Until the last few weeks of the prior election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badger Little got pushed aside and we had the " relentlessly positive " replacement . Substantive policy , who cares ? We want pretty sound bit politics ! <p> The economy , prior to the advent of COVID-19 , was at a growth level of less than half of the assumed economic growth that Labour had used for their fiscal projections prior to their election . Nobody has ever called them on this ... okay , maybe somebody did , but got catcalled off of the stage . Personally , I would rather plan for a sustainable economy rather than a growth economy , but using that as a plan is political suicide . Hence , the Labour PREFU plans assuming 5% GDP growth per year after they were elected . <p> The election should be about policy and policy execution . Jenee is instead arguing that it should be about fluffy bunnies and sound bites . One day I hope to live in a country that votes in an informed manner about policy and competency to conduct policy ... <p> Well said , Yankiwi . The greatest substantive choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCP influence and interference in our politics . And on this choice hangs our environmental well-being ; the value we place on our citizens/residents owning New Zealand 's land , property , and other assets ; the trust we can place in any politician or party ; and - just perhaps - some vague attempt at a decently functioning society . <p> I look forward to seeing the birth of a party that espouses these concepts . At present , the two primary parties appear to have similar actions in regards to nationalism vs globalism . One may be a bit more transparent in regards to globalism , the other shows its real policy via action as compared to words . The environmental well-being idea , sadly we do not yet have a viable party that supports this concept . The green party could have been this party , but was co-opted long ago to become more of a socialist party rather than a sustainable environmentalist party . I have to laugh quite loudly about one of the two co-leaders on the green party having six tamariki , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to be anything close to supporting a sustainable environment . <p> Time is not what it was . 77% of readership is in the USA . Circulation is 2million or less . You front page got to less than 460,000 sold copies out side of USA . The effect of the cover on the digital edition is not known . <p> Time has the world 's largest circulation for a weekly news magazine . The print edition has a readership of 26 million , 20 million of whom are based in the United States . In mid-2012 , its circulation was over 3 million , 14 which fell to 2 million by late 2017. 5 <p> Formerly published by Time Inc. , since November 2018 Time has been published by TIME USA , LLC , owned by Marc Benioff who acquired it from Meredith Corporation two months earlier. 6 <p> Xi and his politburo cronies created this crisis , and continue to make it worse by at first silencing the reports and then lying about the extent of spread . The world is foolishly making plans based on trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die as a result . <p> My prediction is that when the scale of lying is discovered by the world , the deaths will be blamed on China and they will become a pariah state - and probably lose most of their offshore assets to fines and that will be the end of the current politburo - they will be overthrown by underlings . <p> I doubt that it would ever come to such drastic measures . Politicians do n't like change . They 're trying to maintain the status quo , and they 'll do everything in their power to " return to the norm " once the current crisis is behind us . Back to business as usual , reinflating the bubble even faster than previously . <p> xmw in the last half of the 13th century a divine wind put paid to your ancestors catastrophically , and twice . You though seem to suffer from wind that is hardly divine . Never mind , some bicarbonate of soda and a good purge could do your bile wonders . <p> An environment of irrational fear ( or potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunker down , not want to rock the boat in terms of governance . <p> It will all depend on what responsibilities are given to muppets ( Clark , Davis etc. ) and what is given to credible operators ( Robertson , Faafoi etc. ) and what level of tolerance the population will have for measures that contravene the NZBORA ( and for how long ) . <p> Lets call a spade a spade , Labours recent history shows that they can not deliver , that will be magnified under pressure . Cracks in the good times end up as bloody big holes in the tough times . Jacinda must deliver a massive shake up from now on to manage this as her actions to present have been down to luck . <p> The nurses ' union , New Zealand Nurses Organisation , said staff were becoming increasingly anxious about their safety and how well prepared district health boards were to handle the illness . <p> NZNO associate professional services manager Hilary Graham-Smith said the union had experienced an increase in concerns raised by nurses in recent days , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> That was the plan , but who would want to come to a wedding during an epidemic , and who would be stupid enough to have a baby when hosptials are overwhelmed with people dying from wuflu <p> I du n no maybe someone desperate enough for another term ? She is actually behaving like Helen did in 2005 . Winston was out of control and Helen refused to condem him . She even passed a law and applied it retrospectively to get him off . I would not put it past Jacinda to use similar tactics . <p> Wow this Coronavirus has created the perfect storm . The timing is almost perfect to decide the election outcome . Labour was guaranteed a win if they had kept it out by very strong and decisive action and they failed . The case numbers will now be on an exponential trajectory containing this is impossible so in a couple of months its going to go ballistic . Sorry but the COL get the blame for this and rightly so . Sorry Jacinta there was no time to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . We are an island along way from the epicenter it could have been kept out entirely or seriously delayed in time for a vaccine to be developed . If people start dying its game over for Labour . <p> relentless negativity really sums it up , pollies and department heads look like they have been dragged out of bed to attend press conferences , all low energy and uninspiring and you just know it isnt going to get any better as they wont act until they are sure it is too late . <p> " Yet the pressure on Ardern is immense . She needs to embody a competent government during what will be a long six months of relentless negativity . " .. Renee .. I can tell that you are writing this article while at the same time laughing your head off .. <p> True , there is absolutely NOTHING competent about the coalition Government ................. its fractured , dysfunctional and a bloody disgrace that we ended up with the clowns taking over the circus . <p> We have to get rid of the tax- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other choice is a government saying nothing to see here , Rockstar economy BS built on unsustainable property inflation , economy boost from Christchurch earthquake rebuild , everyone whats to come here because they are so great at propping the GDP , Friendly smiles and donations from the CCP revealed on regular basis almost at a level akin to treason and selling out of NZ sovereignty . The Last government certainly was no spend . Drove services into the ground , sold assets or in the case of Solid Energy used as a cash cow . Thankfully that govt no longer exists . BUT look at the ragtag idiots who are out there now who think they have some right to that corrupt legacy . The new generation of morally absence and able to be purchased for any price .

@@31695741 <p> The Justice Department rebuffed a federal judge 's claim that Attorney General William Barr 's handling of special counsel Robert Mueller 's report was " misleading . " <p> In a Tuesday order , D.C. District Court Judge Reggie Walton second-guessed the redactions that appeared in Mueller 's 448-page report and demanded the Justice Department hand over an unredacted version so he could decide if more should be made public . <p> " The Court has grave concerns about the objectivity of the process that preceded the public release of the redacted version of the Mueller Report " and its " impacts on the Justice Department 's subsequent justifications " that the redactions were authorized under the Freedom of Information Act , the President George W. Bush appointee said . <p> " The original redactions in the public report were made by Department attorneys , in consultation with senior members of Special Counsel Mueller 's team , prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney 's Offices , and members of the Intelligence Community , " Kupec said . " In response to FOIA requests , the entire report was then reviewed by career attorneys , including different career attorneys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General played no role . There is no basis to question the work or good faith of any of these career Department lawyers . " <p> The judge said he agreed with the Electronic Privacy Information Center and BuzzFeed , which sued for the full unredacted report under FOIA , that Barr " dubiously handled the public release " of Mueller 's report . Walton said Barr 's " lack of candor " called into question his " credibility " as he took issue with the March 2019 letters Barr wrote prior to the release of the Mueller report and an April 2019 letter and news conference the attorney general gave the morning the report was made public . The judge questioned whether Barr 's intent " was to create a one-sided narrative about the Mueller Report . " <p> Kupec said the Justice Department " stands by " the work of the DOJ officials who made the redaction decisions while defending Barr 's " efforts to provide as much transparency as possible in connection with the Special Counsel 's confidential report . " <p> Mueller delivered his report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barr informed Congress that day he was reviewing it and might be able to advise them of Mueller 's " principal conclusions " that weekend . <p> Barr told Congress on March 24 , 2019 , that Mueller 's investigation " did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election . " The attorney general said Mueller " did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction . " Barr , along with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , determined there was insufficient evidence to establish that President Trump obstructed justice . <p> Mueller sent a letter on March 27 , 2019 , claiming Barr 's letter " did not fully capture the context , nature , and substance " of his investigation 's " work and conclusions . " <p> Barr followed up with another letter on March 29 , 2019 , stating some media and public figures " mischaracterized " his prior letter as a " summary " of Mueller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purport to be an exhaustive recounting " of Mueller 's investigation . <p> " Thanks to the special counsel 's thorough investigation , we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump , " the attorney general stated at an April news conference . <p> Mueller 's report noted his investigation " identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign " but " did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government . " On the issue of obstruction of justice , Mueller said he " determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the president committed crimes " but that " while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime , it also does not exonerate him . " <p> During a May news conference after the report 's release , Mueller offered some cover to Barr in explaining what transpired behind the scenes during the Justice Department 's redaction process . <p> " At one point in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mueller said . " The attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once . We appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public , and I certainly do not question the attorney general 's good faith in that decision . " <p> That same day , the Justice Department and the Office of Special Counsel put on a united front to clarify the issue of whether Trump would have been charged if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion stopping sitting presidents from being indicted . <p> " The attorney general has previously stated that the special counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that , but for the OLC opinion , he would have found the president obstructed justice . The special counsel 's report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination -- one way or the other -- about whether the president committed a crime .

@@31709041 <h> Most schools are completely unprepared for coronavirus and virtual learning <p> The threat of COVID-19 , the novel coronavirus , is forcing educators across the country to think about what they 'll do if they have to close their schools for weeks or even months at a time . State and federal agencies have advised schools to create online learning plans to minimize the disruption to student learning . For some schools , that 's a small leap . Their students have internet connections at home , laptops they can work from , teachers who know how to design online lessons and a strong foundation of in-school blended learning experience . <p> But the fact is , these schools are rare . Most schools are completely unprepared -- or , at best , woefully underprepared -- for coronavirus and virtual learning .

CoSN members have been turning to each other for advice and support about how to approach coronavirus and virtual learning . But Holland is not optimistic . The data just do n't support optimism . <p> According to the latest survey data from the Pew Research Center , 73 percent of adults have broadband internet at home . But the differences based on income are striking . While 92 percent of adults from households earning $75,000 or more per year say they have broadband internet at home , just 56 percent of adults from households earning below $30,000 say the same . About 17 percent of adults access the internet from home through a smartphone only .

If entire K-12 districts move online , what can schools expect of early elementary schoolers ? Not much . Younger children do n't have the independent learning skills , attention spans or social-emotional maturity to succeed in virtual learning environments for very long , let alone the troubleshooting skills they will inevitably need to manage whatever technology they 're using . Many middle and even high schoolers are n't much better equipped . And what 's more , many of those older students may have to help watch their younger siblings during extended school closures , leaving them little time to tackle assignments of their own . <p> A host of organizations have stepped into the fray offering training and advice for teachers contemplating online learning for the first time . Noah Dougherty , a senior design principal at the education consulting firm Education Elements , wrote in a blog post last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility and a recognition that the controlled structure of a school is not replicable online . " Some districts have already described their school closure plans as though students will be able to cycle through their regular school schedules from home .

Then came the piano chords , trumpet blasts , violin serenades and even the clanging of pots and pans -- all of it spilling from people 's homes , out of windows and from balconies , and rippling across rooftops . <p> Finally , on Saturday afternoon , a nationwide round of applause broke out for the doctors on the medical front lines fighting the spread of Europe 's worst coronavirus outbreak . <p> " It was from our hearts , to say thanks and show that we can get past this , " said Emma Santachiara , 73 , who came out onto the terrace of her apartment in the Monteverde section of Rome to clap with her granddaughters . <p> Italians remain essentially under house arrest as the nation , the European front in the global fight against the coronavirus , has ordered extraordinary restrictions on their movement to prevent contagions . <p> As of Saturday , the virus had infected more than 21,000 Italians and left more than 1,400 dead , according to national officials -- the worst toll reported anywhere outside of China .

On Saturday , one image circulating widely showed a nurse cradling the Italian peninsula in her arms . <p> Parents posted pictures of unicorns and rainbows drawn by young children with the hashtag " It will all be OK .

Amphastar undertakes no obligation to revise or update information in this press release or the conference call referenced above to reflect events or circumstances in the future , and if new information becomes available or if subsequent events called Amphastar 's expectations to change . <p> I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker , Jason Shandell , President . Thank you . Please go ahead , sir . <p> Thank you , operator . Good afternoon , and welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Jason Shandell , President of Amphastar . I 'm joined today by our CFO , Bill Peters . We appreciate you joining us on the call today and look forward to speaking with you and answering any questions you may have . <p> As you can see from our financial results , Amphastar had a strong year and is in a position of operational and financial strength , driven by continued execution of our long-term strategy and focus on our key growth drivers and complex pipeline . <p> Our net revenues for 2019 increased by more than 9% to approximately $322 million and our gross profit increased more than 23% to approximately $132 million driven by strong sales of Primatene Mist and our critical care portfolio , which continues to show strong demand due to competitor shortages . <p> Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $41.8 million . Gross margins also increased year-over-year from 36% to 41% , as Primatene Mist and our other high-margin products continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales . We expect this margin expansion trend to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in research and development will allow us to deliver even greater value to patients and shareholders over the long term . <p> Since our last earnings call , I 'm happy to announce that the FDA has accepted 2 more ANDAs , which have GDUFA dates in the fourth quarter of 2020 . One of the ANDAs is for regadenoson , which is a generic of Lexiscan . This ANDA included a Paragraph IV certification , and we were sued by the brand sponsor , which triggered a 30-month stay . We now have 7 ANDAs on file with the agency , targeting products with a market size of approximately $1.9 billion based on IQVIA data for the 12 months ended December 31 , 2019 . <p> The strong momentum of Primatene Mist sales continues to increase at a greater rate as we launched the product into Walmart in November 2019 , and we continue to increase consumer awareness through our marketing strategies . As we discussed on the last earnings call , traditional television advertising has been extremely effective in building consumer awareness about Primatene Mist . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels and saw a very good return on investment . Therefore , beginning in January 2020 , we expanded airing of our commercials on the major broadcast networks , targeting prime yet cost-effective advertising slots with the national recognized TV shows , including Judge Judy , Dr. Phil , The Price Is Right and many other widely viewed programs . This strong advertising push , combined with an allergy season that arrived earlier due to the mild winter , resulted in very strong same-store sales across all of our retail partners . <p> Weekly store sales as of the last week of the fourth quarter of 2019 have increased by more than 140% compared to the first week of the third quarter 2019 , which was just before the TV ads began airing . We are very excited about the long-term prospects of this brand and are currently in discussions with other large potential retail partners . Based on the continued effectiveness of our advertising strategy and the continued positive trend in retail store sales , we maintain our guidance of Primatene Mist achieving an annual rate of revenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products from our IMS facility to be another strong driver of revenues in 2020 . We recently issued a press release announcing that the FDA approved our supplemental ANDA for sodium bicarbonate , which is for manufacturing the product in our new state-of-the-art production line at IMS . This FDA approval further validates our strength in scaling up our manufacturing capabilities in response to increased demand for our products and greatly increases our manufacturing capacity at our IMS facility . Our recent approval will help us meet the high demand for our critical care injectable products and provide us with capacity for future pipeline products , which will be a source of significant revenues going forward . <p> With respect to our epinephrine 30-ml vial ANDA , we received a minor CRL in January 2020 and responded to the agency in 1 business day . As a result , we have a GDUFA date in the second quarter of 2020 and are confident that we will receive approval . Regarding our complex injectable product , which has been through 3 review cycles of the agency , we received the CRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . As a result , we have a new GDUFA date in Q3 or Q4 2020 , depending if another pre-approval inspection is needed . <p> As we discussed on our last earnings call , we have another ANDA on file with the FDA for a very complex injectable product that is off-patent and has never had generic competition due to its complexity . We had a productive mid-cycle review meeting with the agency earlier this year and have a GDUFA date for this product in the second quarter 2020 . <p> With respect to our insulin programs , our first human clinical trials using our insulin began in Q4 2019 and is ongoing . Based on recent FDA guidance and direct communications with the agency , we remain hopeful that our strong analytical tools , including characterization of complex molecules , will result in the FDA determining that immunogenicity studies would not be required . This determination would save significant time and expenses , thereby allowing us to enter the market sooner than previously expected . Furthermore , based on recent FDA guidance and the purity of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve interchangeable status for our insulin products . <p> Turning to our intranasal naloxone NDA . We have a meeting with the agency scheduled for later this month . The purpose of this meeting is to confirm with the agency that we 've addressed all of the issues identified in the CRL and FDA 's general advice letters . If the agency agrees that we 've addressed all issues , we could resubmit the NDA this year . <p> Finally , I would like to address the impact of the coronavirus on Amphastar . At this time , over 99% of the labor force in our China facility has returned to work , and thankfully , none of our employees have contracted the virus . Furthermore , our supply chain is well intact as we had previously built up significant inventory of starting material and API from China as we strategically planned for potential disruptions related to trade negotiations and the African swine flu . As a result of these planning efforts , we have at least 2 years inventory of starting material and API located in our California facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. Furthermore , it should be emphasized that Amphastar manufactures all of our finished products in the United States , which further insulates the company 's commercial operations from supply disruptions related to global instability . <p> I will now turn the call over to Bill to go through the fourth quarter financial results . <p> Thank you , Jason . Sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 7% to $83.4 million from $89.7 million in the previous year 's period . Importantly , Primatene Mist achieved a very strong sales of $9 million as we loaded our product nationally into Walmart and had large orders from all of the other national drugstore chains . Enoxaparin sales dropped to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter from $19.1 million in the prior year 's fourth quarter as a market shortage in 2018 resulted in a temporary surge in enoxaparin sales last year . <p> Gross margins improved to 40% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 39% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to sales of higher-margin products such as Primatene Mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million from $2.6 million on television and radio expenses for marketing Primatene Mist . General and administrative spending decreased 24% to $10.5 million from $13.8 million primarily due to decreased legal expenses since we settled our lawsuit with Momenta and Sandoz in June of 2019 . Research and development expenditures increased 17% to $19.6 million from $16.7 million due to increased clinical trial expenses for inhalation products and increased expenses associated with API development at our Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals subsidiary . <p> The company reported a net loss of $1 million or $0.02 per share compared to last year 's fourth quarter net income of $1.9 million or $0.04 per share . The company reported adjusted net income of $3.6 million or $0.07 per share compared to an adjusted net income of approximately $6.2 million or $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter of last year . Adjusted earnings include -- or exclude amortization , equity compensation , impairments and onetime events . <p> In the fourth quarter , we had cash flows provided by operations of approximately $5.7 million . During the quarter , the company repurchased approximately $13.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to over $22 million . <p> Let me review a few of the financial assumptions that we are using as we look to 2020 . We expect sales growth to be driven by Primatene Mist and 1 or 2 ANDAS , which may be approved later this year . Our sales have already gotten a boost this year from the approval of the supplemental ANDA for sodium bicarbonate , which effectively increases the capacity for prefilled syringes , many of which are in drug shortage by allowing us to manufacture in our newly modernized facility . We have already begun shipping product from this new room and believe that the sales opportunity for these shortage products is approximately $20 million annually . We expect additional sales growth to come from our ANP subsidiary . Last year , we booked $1.5 million in third-party sales from our ANP business . And at this time , we believe that sales from this facility will more than double in 2020 . We expect gross margins to increase as we sell more of our high-margin Primatene Mist , and we anticipate higher margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense will rise as we plan to increase our advertising for Primatene Mist . However , the advertising expense will decrease as a percentage of Primetime Mist sales to provide earnings leverage . We expect G&amp;A spending to decrease as a percentage of sales due to lower spending on legal matters . We expect research and development spending will continue to increase in both dollar terms and as a percentage of sales , as we currently have 2 inhalation and 1 insulin clinical trials ongoing , and we continue to increase the R&amp;D work at our ANP facility . <p> I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions and answers . <p> And then for epinephrine vials , I think you had previously indicated , we could get a response from the FDA by the end of April . Is that still the expectation ? And then if approved , how should we think about that potential market opportunity and the market share you 're targeting ? <p> Sure . So yes , we 've said that we have a GDUFA date for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of that minor CRL . And so when you do the math , that does come out to April . And in terms of market opportunity , we believe that we will be the sole generic and should have a reasonable share of the market . <p> What we 've said so far is that we had $9 million in sales in the fourth quarter . Just under $2 million of that was stocking for Walmart , and we expect significant growth this year , and we 're targeting our goal of the run rate of $65 million next year . So those are the parameters we 've given . <p> Yes . So with those parameters , the $9 million in the fourth quarter , and as I said in my prepared remarks that we just started airing on network television commercials beginning just in January . So with the Walmart launch and the push into mainstream television , we think that the growth will continue at the rate that we 've seen . <p> Two questions . You mentioned the ramp-up in DTC , a national TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon ? Or is it just this quarter ? And related to that , it looks like you 've done about $10 million in SG&amp;A each of the last 2 quarters . With this ramp up , should we expect kind of higher quarterly run rates in SG&amp;A ? And then secondly , you mentioned you have the 2 GDUFA dates this year for these large multiple $100 million branded products that do n't currently have generic . Can you give us a little more color on the timing of the current GDUFA dates as you know them ? <p> Sure . So in terms of the advertising push , yes , I think we do want to continue this throughout the year . The return on investment has been really good , and we think it will continue . And again , as I was saying in my prepared remarks that although it is the broadcast TV and national television , it 's still very cost-effective . So we 're targeting the prime yet cost-effective advertising slots . So we will continue with that . And in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes . So we have our -- we break out our G&amp;A from our selling , so the selling , distribution or marketing line . You 've seen some significant growth in that . And that growth is really all advertising for Primatene Mist . And as I said earlier , we are going to grow that -- those dollars relative this year . However , as a percentage of sales of Primatene Mist that will drop . So we will get earnings leverage on that . <p> And then in terms of the 2 undisclosed complex injectable products without generic competition , the first one that we 've been talking about for quite a while now , that 's the one that 's been through 3 review cycles . And we did a pretty fast turnaround . On the last call , we had talked about getting the CRL in the fourth quarter . And at that point , we were just assessing it , and we felt confident that it was very addressable . And we predicted that we would respond in January , which we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- we do n't give a specific date , but it is Q3 of this year . However , if there was another pre-approval inspection that was needed , then it would be Q4 . With respect to the other one that just was on file recently . This is still the first cycle review . So that one is a Q2 GDUFA date . And because it does have the competitive generic status , we had a very productive mid-cycle review meeting and got a lot of clarity through that meeting . So we are looking forward to a response on that in the second quarter . <p> So on Primatene demand , this is a promotion-sensitive product . And in this period now of more restrictive movements and social distancing , what are your thoughts on the potential impact to demand on Primatene ? Is that something you 're contemplating in any way ? That 's number one . And then number two , I joined late , so maybe I missed this , but any update on your inhalation pipeline and what portion of your file pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent to which you 're going to be filing later this year on inhalation generics . <p> Definitely . So yes , let 's start with Primatene . It 's really exciting . I mean , to your point , in this day and age of the coronavirus , people are reluctant to go even to their doctor 's office or into a hospital facility . And the fact that you can order either online or very quickly go into your local retailer , we 're seeing very strong demand . Actually , in San Francisco , we heard that there 's a shortage of Primatene . People are just buying up as much medicine over-the-counter as they can . So there 's sort of been a panic due to the coronavirus . And we are seeing an increase in demand . Also , we believe that increase is related to the mild winter and the early allergy season . But it is interesting . And we do believe that we have a competitive advantage as the only over-the-counter asthma inhaler . So you can avoid the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your temporary relief of intermittent asthma . <p> And then with respect to our inhalation portfolio , I know Bill has talked about some of the clinical trial expenses . And so we do have 2 generic inhalation products that are currently in ongoing clinical trials . And of those -- so right now , we do n't have any ANDAs on file . They 're actively in the clinics and going through trials , and we still are targeting filing 1 inhalation ANDA this year . <p> This is Tian on for Serge . I just had a few . So I think the FDA recently just approved the first generic for ProAir in late February . So I just wanted to get your thoughts on maybe how this might impact or compete with Primatene sales in the near term . And then in terms of other retailers for Primatene Mist , do you have any other updates regarding additional stores or even online that are being discussed at this point ? <p> Definitely , definitely . So let me address the ProAir question because it 's an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after Primatene Mist was approved in late 2018 , in early 2019 , the brands launched authorized generics . So technically , there have been generic albuterols on the market for over a year and really has not had impact to our product . Again , I think the real benefit here is because you do not need to go to the doctor . You do not need a prescription . And this is a historical phenomenon because even back during the CFC days , when albuterol is only $2 , and we were actually not promoting Primatene , there was still strong sales of $65 million . So we still feel very confident with our Primatene Mist being the only over-the-counter asthma inhaler available . And with respect to other retailers , definitely . We are currently in discussions with several retailers , and we should have updates for that in the coming quarters . <p> Thank you , operator . So I just want to , again , thank everybody for joining us today . I know it 's been a very difficult time recently with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and we 're going to get through it . I want to make sure everybody stays healthy and safe and want everybody to realize that Amphastar continues to grow , and our China facility is strong , and we look forward to providing future updates on a go-forward basis . So we 'll talk to you soon . Thanks , everybody .

Recently , the ban was clarified to include Taiwan , which , according to the WHO , is considered a special administrative region of the People 's Republic of China . ( This was subsequently dropped after Taiwan complained . -- Ed . ) <p> The ban however does not cover Filipino citizens and holders of permanent resident visas issued by the Philippine government .

The Supreme Court stated that the deployment ban was a valid limitation on the right to travel , on the ground of " public safety .

@@41996841 <h> Asian value stocks attractive amid pandemic recovery <p> Asian businesses are gradually rebooting after governments quelled the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic , drawing attention to equity opportunities in the region . Even before the onset of COVID-19 , Asian value stocks were trading at especially attractive levels . Now that the valuation dispersion has widened further , we believe that value stocks -- companies that are ( arguably ) inexpensive owing to a short-term controversy -- are poised to outperform once markets stabilize this year . <p> Indeed , there 's a precedent for such a move : value stocks in Asia ex Japan have outperformed in the initial stage of previous crisis-to-recovery cycles , such as after the global financial crisis in 2009 -- 2010 and after the European debt crisis in 2012 -- 2013 . And the massive amounts of fiscal stimulus being pumped into regional economies could help support cyclical companies that are more dominant among value stocks . <p> Faster Out of the Block <p> The coronavirus battle is uneven across Asia and equity benchmarks for the individual countries reflect that divergence . For example , Indian and Indonesian stocks have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korea , since markets began to tumble on February 21 and through the rebound in recent weeks . <p> Still , there will be plenty of challenges , even for successful economies . As factories ramp up in China and South Korea , exporters will face slack demand because the US and major economies in Europe are still in a self-enforced lockdown . And these countries still must remain vigilant to guard against a potential second wave of outbreaks that could impact economic activity and markets . <p> Easing Pandemic Pain : Telecom , Memory Chips <p> Given that progress will be bumpy , it is important to be selective . That requires homing in on specific industries and companies addressing the challenges of the coronavirus crisis . For example , to accommodate social distancing and the demand for remote work , Asian memory-chip manufacturers and telecom networks are industries that will experience robust demand , in our view . <p> Hardware memory supply had thinned even before the COVID-19 crisis .

We believe memory makers are expected to benefit from these trends . <p> In recent years , concerns about investment in 5G network upgrades weighed on network operators ' valuation , as did regulation and pressure on rates . Now , as the pandemic forces enterprises to embrace remote work , robust network connectivity and bandwidth for home offices are must-haves . That 's a blessing for leading network operators in China , especially given a relaxation of competition among Asian telcos .

Solvency will determine which companies survive and which perish in the economic shutdown . Balance sheets must be tested for resilience amid downturns of differing durations and revenue reductions of differing magnitudes . <p> For those investors who can identify resilient industries and drill down to distill balance-sheet strength , we believe the region offers attractive opportunities in companies that are positioned to do well in the nascent pandemic recovery and over the longer term .

The pandemic has spread to all 50 states , and the lack of confidence in the administration 's efforts , combined with the shutdown of businesses , schools and restaurants , has triggered steep declines in the stock market -- which Trump has always viewed as a key form of polling for his presidency . <p> The administration 's goal this week includes pushing through Congress another economic stimulus package that is likely to top $1.3 trillion , the centerpiece of which will be checks sent directly to thousands of Americans . <p> In recent days , President Donald Trump has latched onto the idea of the checks as a way to quickly give Americans money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's social and business life shuts down as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S. <p> Behind the scenes , the Treasury Department is working on the mechanics of giving Americans direct checks , with the amount depending on one 's income and family size . The administration has considered sending anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per check and has proposed Congress spend a total of $500 billion on the measure , with the IRS issuing the first of two rounds of payments starting April 6 , according to the Treasury proposal obtained by POLITICO . <p> " We are looking at different numbers . We are looking at timing that would be different , " Trump told reporters Wednesday . " Splitting the time , splitting the payments . We are looking at a lot of different things . It has n't been determined yet , but it will shortly be determined . But people want to go big . Everybody seems to want to go big . " <p> The direct payments have received a much better reception on Capitol Hill than the president 's earlier proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have helped both employees and employers . <p> One senior administration official said top economic aides presented the president with a list of possible options this week to help Americans financially , and he liked the check idea because it 's an easily understood concept and the money goes out quickly , a second senior administration official said . <p> Sen. Josh Hawley ( R-Mo. ) also outlined the check proposal earlier this week and then spoke with Trump about it on Wednesday , a person familiar with the conversation said . <p> Other Republican lawmakers seem equally amenable to it . " It 's a novel idea , and if it will help a lot of people help the economy because we 're in challenging times right now , " said Sen. Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) , one of the lawmakers involved in brainstorming ways to financially help out airlines as part of the broad rescue package . " It 's a lot of money , but the idea is to put cash in people 's hands to mitigate the economic effects . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it everyone ? Is it someone who is laid off ? Is it someone who is quarantined ? I just need to see the final details , " Sen. John Kennedy ( R-La. ) said . " That 's more of a demand-side remedy . I think to solve this problem we 're going to need both demand and supply . " <p> Senior administration officials caution the idea of a payroll tax cut could still reappear in the coming weeks , with one official noting it still remains under consideration within the administration . <p> Trump 's top economic aides are also weighing which industries will receive government help in the form of loans . The Treasury proposal earmarked $150 billion for industries slammed by the coronavirus downturn , money that would fund loans or loan guarantees . <p> An additional $50 billion in loans would support the airlines . The Trump administration supports limits on raising executive compensation and reducing service , but Democrats are pushing for stricter provisions . <p> But the Treasury proposal does not specify which industries could access that $150 billion pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbying effort among hotels , cruise ships , the tourism industry and retailers , all of whom have been in close touch with the White House about the sudden and sharp declines in their businesses . <p> The lobbying is intense because the Senate wants to negotiate this third coronavirus rescue package by the end of the week -- putting one of the largest stimulus packages in modern history on an incredibly tight time frame .

@@42012041 <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> TIME TO MOVE ON ? Health Secretary Matt Hancock will launch England 's all-important test and trace program this morning as ministers tell the nation it 's " time to move on " from the Dominic Cummings scandal . From 9 a.m. people will start receiving phone calls , text messages and emails asking them to self-isolate if they 've come into close contact with someone who recently tested positive for the coronavirus . Hancock is touring ( virtual ) broadcast studios right now to set out more details of the scheme , and Downing Street hopes that what should be a pivotal moment in the fight against coronavirus will be enough to push the Cummings story off the front pages for good . Tory insiders believe they have now weathered the storm after a pretty disastrous week -- and that without further developments , the anger will start to subside . <p> Day 6 : Downing Street will have been unhappy to see Boris Johnson 's refusal to launch an inquiry into Cummings ' behavior lead the BBC News at Ten last night , and variations of the story make the splash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metro and the i this morning . But crucially none of the right-leaning newspapers are now following suit , and naturally TV and radio bulletins this morning are leading with the big launch of test and trace in the coming hours . On BBC Newsnight last night ( clip here ) , Political Editor Nick Watt concluded that angry Tory MPs are conceding defeat . " The impression I 'm getting is they are very reluctantly throwing in the towel , " Watt said . One Johnson loyalist tells him the PM has " burnt up a lot of goodwill with the party and the public . " <p> Number crunching : Former Cabinet Minister Amber Rudd added her name to the list of Tory critics on ITV 's Peston show last night , saying Cummings " should quit because he 's making things worse . " She added : " People have been great during the lockdown ... and now they 're confused . And that makes them angry , and I think that 'll have consequences . " The Guardian reckons the number of Tory MPs calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more condemning his actions . They include one senior minister -- Penny Mordaunt -- two government whips and a host of party grandees . But the rate of fresh criticism from within the party is slowing , and the threat of further ministerial resignations appears to be petering out . <p> In full agreement : Fascinatingly , it seems Labour leader Keir Starmer agrees it 's time to " move on " and talk about test and trace instead . Labour remained half in the shadows throughout this crisis , refusing to come out shrieking for Cummings to quit -- preferring to sit back and watch the Tory Party implode . Now it appears Starmer senses a willingness among the public to get back to the matter in hand . " Dominic Cummings broke the rules . It is as simple as that , " Starmer writes bluntly in a Daily Mirror op-ed . " I say to the prime minister : we can not go on like this . We can not lose another week to this farce . We need to get back on track . " Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250,000 tests a day , rather than calling for Dom 's head . It 's a very different approach to what we 've seen before . <p> Woop-woop ! That 's the sound of da police ! So it 's all eyes now on Durham Constabulary , in whose hands the fate of Britain 's second-most powerful man surely lies . The police investigation continues into Cummings ' unorthodox 90-minute " eye test " along the A-roads of County Durham , and plenty of observers in Westminster believe that if -- somehow -- the cops conclude this innocent visual inspection did in fact break lockdown rules , then it 's probably curtains for his Downing Street career . One well-connected Tory predicts dozens more MPs and even party donors would rise up in anger were Cummings to try to cling on if police concluded he broke lockdown laws . But this is Dominic Cummings we 're talking about , so who knows ? <p> Just for the record : Helpfully , Matt Hancock was asked directly by TalkRADIO 's Charlotte Ivers last night to clarify who ultimately decides whether something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where we 've made regulations that are mandatory , there is a normal system and process in which the police police those , " Hancock said . " And then the courts system is there ultimately to make the decision . " So that 's pretty clear , at least . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Working with Enel , one of the world 's largest utility companies , Goldman Sachs structured the first bond linked to the United Nations ' Sustainable Development Goals . The bond ties Enel 's cost of capital to its strategic commitment of sustainable progress . Explore stories like these and more in our new Sustainability Report. ** <p> One other thing to watch for : The only other development that could conceivably do for Cummings now would be some new piece of evidence suggesting he did not tell the truth in his hour-long rose garden address . " I did not stop on the way " to Durham , Cummings said for example , which presumably means he had a full tank of petrol and did not need to call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further trip outside was explained away ; every sighting of him accounted for , and as long as no one disputes it all there should be no further problem . It 's well worth listening to ( or reading -- there 's a text version ) FT legal expert David Allen Green 's lengthy walk-through of Cummings ' No. 10 statement , which he says read uncannily like a witness statement drafted by lawyers . So is the case watertight ? We 'll have to wait and see . <p> Long-term damage : Assuming Cummings is now safe , the big -- and unknowable -- question being discussed both inside and outside Downing Street is just how serious and far-reaching is the damage that 's been done . " It 's not a bubble story , but it 's not era-defining , " one supportive Tory adviser insists . " I think the media want it to be , and are in danger of over-reaching . It definitely had an impact , but do you really think we 'll be talking about this in 2024 ? I doubt it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some damage , trust-wise , " the source says . " Cummings is used to running campaigns , where the long-term is n't an issue . But lost trust is hard to regain . He 'll be his own downfall -- now , or in a year or so . " <p> Inside government : Writing in the Spectator this morning , Katy Balls says some Cabinet ministers outside Johnson 's inner circle see an opportunity to at least bring Cummings down a peg or two . " He will struggle to command the same respect as before , or even to give orders , " one tells her , perhaps a little optimistically . Others agree . " We need to stop treating him as some high prophet rather than an adviser , " another says . Good luck with that . <p> Where did it all go wrong ? In retrospect this whole affair went badly wrong for No. 10 in the initial 24 hours after the stories first broke . An explanation that he panicked out of fear for his child ; an acceptance it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology ; all of this would surely have been enough to dampen much of the fire . The fateful decision to come out fighting in the usual Vote Leave style -- " he is n't remotely bothered , it 's more fake news , " a " friend " briefed hacks -- backfired , enraging public , media and Tory MPs alike . And the long delay in explaining what happened -- giving the Guardian the opportunity to reveal the trip to Barnard Castle as an agenda-setting Day 2 splash -- allowed a sense of rolling crisis to envelope the whole weekend . " It 's crisis comms 101 , " one experienced spinner reflects . " You get all the info out in the first news cycle . Clearly that did n't happen . " <p> On the up : Still , the comms around this crisis feels somewhat back on track now , and Boris Johnson breezed through yesterday 's Commons liaison committee hearing without a major disaster -- read the main takeaways here from my colleagues Charlie Cooper and Emilio Casalicchio . Few of those watching were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Boris is as Boris does , and No. 10 is ( rightly ) confident that few beyond the bubble will care . Given the majority of people have better things to do on a Wednesday afternoon than watch a 90-minute Zoom chat among politicians , the handful of awkward moments ( Caroline Nokes and Stephen Timms offering up the unexpected slam-dunkers ) will no doubt be forgotten . <p> Sketchwriters ' verdict : The Evening Standard 's Joe Murphy is on superb form this morning while moonlighting as a sketchwriter , suggesting the liaison committee did not prove to be the crack outfit some had hoped . " On TV and radio , the pundits rolled the words ' liaaaaiiison committee ' over their tongues in anticipation of a skilled defenestration of the prime minister , " Murphy notes , " much as they once did about Saddam Hussein 's ' Elite Republican Guard ' in the weeks before that military force fled the field in disarray . " Ouch . The Times ' Quentin Letts was equally unimpressed . " Liaison committee : the name suggests something furtive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Len Deighton or Joan Collins . The reality ... was rather different . A buffet of bluster , a feast of froth . " <p> Alt . view:John Crace in the Guardian reckons the PM had a torrid time , however , concluding new committee Chairman Bernard Jenkin " turned out to be no patsy ... to many people 's surprise -- possibly even his own . " The Indy 's Tom Peck was unimpressed by the PM 's repeated pleas to " move on , " noting : " When Scotland 's chief medical officer was found breaking the rules of lockdown , Scotland had ' moved on ' within about nine hours . It ' moved on ' the moment the chief medical officer did the decent thing and ' moved on . ' " The Telegraph 's Michael Deacon thought Johnson sounded " weary and impatient " at the persistent questions about Cummings . Even Conservative Home 's Andrew Gimson concluded the best that could be said is the PM showed " fighting spirit " throughout . <p> Last night 's TV : A decent day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBC Newsnight , a show they despise for its supposed liberal leanings and which they 've banned ministers from appearing on for even longer than ITV 's Good Morning Britain . Claims on social media that star presenter Emily Maitlis had been forced to step aside from last night 's show following the reprimand from BBC bosses over that dramatic opening statement on Tuesday night were flatly denied by her editor Esme Wren -- and this morning ( at 2.30 a.m. , no less ) Maitlis confirmed she had chosen to take the night off following the row . Still , Downing Street is gleeful at striking a blow -- while the Cummings-haters are livid at BBC top brass for caving in . Quite what happens if police conclude Cummings did in fact break the rules , as Maitlis asserted , is anyone 's guess . <p> Now read this:The Telegraph has another article from one of Cummings ' old acquaintances from university , the magazine editor Lebby Eyres , her third such piece inside a year . " It was always a central contradiction in Dom 's character at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously dressing as an extra from ' Reservoir Dogs , ' " she notes . " All that 's changed now is he 's swapped his Ray-Bans for a beanie . " The rose garden performance , she adds , was Cummings on his best behavior -- yet still certain traits shone through . " He spoke with the exasperated air of someone explaining a complex sum to a child , " she writes . " Dom has a knack of making people feel ever so slightly stupid when he talks to them , even if it is about his wife vomiting on the floor . " <h> TESTING , TESTING <p> BETTER LATE THAN NEVER : Eleven long weeks after the government stopped testing and contact-tracing people with COVID-like symptoms in the community , England 's much-anticipated test and trace system finally launches today . Just 10 people had died of COVID-19 when Public Health England stopped community testing back on March 12 ; today , with the launch of NHS Test and Trace two and a half months later , the official death toll is approaching 40,000 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under questioning from former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday , Boris Johnson finally stated what has been painfully obvious for weeks -- that test and trace should never have stopped , and that successive U.K. governments left Britain woefully unprepared for this type of pandemic . <p> In black and white : " We did have a test , track and trace operation in the early days , " the PM said . " But unfortunately , we did not have the capacity in Public Health England , to be absolutely blunt , we did n't have the enzymes , we did n't have the test kits , we just did n't have the volume . Nor did we have enough experienced trackers really to mount the kind of operation that they did in some other eastern Asian countries , for instance . I think the brutal reality , Jeremy , is that this country did not learn the lessons of previous corona outbreaks SARS or MERS . And we did n't have a test operation ready to go on the scale that we needed . " <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest rate of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic among countries that produce comparable data , according to excess mortality figures , " the FT reports this morning after another bleak session of data-crunching . " The U.K. has registered 59,537 more deaths than usual since the week ending March 20 , indicating that the virus has directly or indirectly killed 891 people per million . At this stage of the pandemic , that is a higher rate of death than in any country for which high-quality data exist . The absolute number of excess deaths in the U.K. is also the highest in Europe , and second only to the U.S. in global terms . " <p> Time to move on , again : The focus in Whitehall now however is on making sure the new system works , so that England can continue to unlock its economy without a second peak . Johnson had promised us a " world-beating " system in place by Monday , which was always a little optimistic patent nonsense , and yesterday his test and trace chief Dido Harding confirmed it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn over the next few days and weeks , " she said .

" The program , she said , would get " better and better " through the summer , " and we 'll have something that 's really ready to do the job we need it to do as we head into autumn and winter . " Story here via the FT . <p> How it works : The BBC has a decent explainer here , but in short anyone who develops coronavirus symptoms must self-isolate and seek a test immediately . If it comes back positive , they will be asked to provide a list of anyone they have been in close contact with for 15 minutes or more in the previous 48 hours . Those people will then in turn be contacted and asked to self-isolate for 14 days -- regardless of whether they are sick or not . Even those requiring urgent eye tests on spouse 's birthdays will be asked to stay home . <p> Are you ready ? Sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready England 's new army of contact tracers really are to take up the challenge .

Others say key software keeps crashing and that log-ins have not been made available . But a department of health official insists to Playbook that all is well . " We 've got 25,000 contact tracers recruited , but only 2,000-odd people tested positive yesterday , " the official said . " So naturally not every contact tracer is going to be used tomorrow . There may well be kinks , but this is why we are going live ahead of June 1 -- to give us time to iron out any teething issues .

Scientific advisers say the system will only work well if England 's testing program can return results more quickly . And there 's still no sign of that all-important NHSX app , which was meant to be ready by now but has seemingly been delayed indefinitely . <p> Meanwhile in Scotland : A " test and protect " program similar in all but name to the one launched in England will also go live north of the border today , to coincide with lockdown restrictions finally beginning to ease .

Which businesses will fail , which ones will survive ? Is government becoming more authoritarian ? Has the age of globalization come to an end ? <p> Some lessons learned will be universal . Others , I suspect , will be specific to New Zealand , an island nation , remote and sparsely populated , that defies comparison . <p> I left my hometown of Berlin at the beginning of March .

I noticed that no one was talking about the virus yet -- the fear had not set in . It was strange . I had traveled for 27 hours but I felt like I had gone back in time and gained a month .

And the restrictions were tough : no meetings with friends , no traveling by car unless it was to go shopping for food or medicine . <p> " We only have 102 cases , " Ardern said in way of explanation . " But so did Italy once . " On the eve of lockdown , we drove to a popular beach , a vast stretch of white sand , eerily empty . <p> * * * <p> When Ardern made her announcement -- starting the clock on four long weeks of confinement , that would later be extended by another three -- she said government modeling showed tens of thousands of deaths .

" It was meant to be a withering critique of the national character : indifferent , unemotional , complacent . Be that as it may , now , in the midst of a major crisis , a certain calmness seems to have served New Zealanders well . <p> Tucked away safely , at a distance of some 18,000 kilometers , I followed the news back home where Berliners were openly flouting the rules .

The difference is both quantitative and qualitative . When I Zoomed with a Berlin friend of mine , a philosopher , he summed it up neatly : " New Zealand is a community , not a society .

A zero-tolerance policy , once established , can not be abandoned . International borders will remain closed indefinitely . ( Travel to and from Australia may be allowed sooner . ) If no vaccine is found and other nations learn to live with the virus , eventually gaining herd immunity , New Zealand will be the odd one out . <p> Some New Zealanders believe that , given the circumstances , isolation has its merits .

Teams or entire departments could come here , go into a mandatory quarantine and then work remotely from a safe haven . In that scenario , New Zealand would turn into a kind of home office for global business . <p> Which reminds me of a joke that my daughters keep telling because they love being here .

@@41946941 <p> The difference with what we 're seeing today in automation IMO is that during the agricultural and industrial revolution workers could be trained to oversee/work with the tech because their new work still remained manual . <p> With this automation revolution , the workers need to be trained to oversee not machines , exactly , but computing systems and code . That requires a certain level of specific intelligence . I do n't see a place for manual workers in the new automated systems . And they form the mass . So what will happen to them ? <p> This was what motivated the Luddites of England and Saboteurs of France in the industrial revolution - and yet the invention of the automated loom did not eradicate employment in the 18th and 19th century , nor did the invention of the production robot in the car industry in the 20th . What happened was that different kinds of industries and different kinds of work emerged .

Most people of the one billion people living in the first world are totally ignorant that for the other 6 billion inhabitants ? 10-20 a week is a good wage . <p> Money acts as a gearbox between wants and things . However there are physical limits on things . E.g. if an average Chinese citizen consumed as much oil as an American they would consume 200% of the world 's oil supply . <p> The reason why 1/7 of the world 's inhabitants have a living standard 50 times that of the rest of the world is a legacy of first mover advantage , industrialisation , control of key currency , an educated workforce and the expectation of the population . <p> However automation is a great leveller .

And accepting this as some kind of ' normal ' is not right . People need to be showing dissent , and anger , not cowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . That does n't mean abusing key workers or pointlessly ignoring lockdown .

We are not accepting being told to go to work but then being told we ca n't socialise afterwards . The message that social distancing will only last and exist as long as we consent to it , NOT how long they tell us we ' need ' to be doing it . <p> Not public investment then , you credit it all to the markets . Is the carnage we 're starting to see today with increasing poverty , loss of rights , homelessness etc etc not related to the increasing dominance of the markets and lack of public investment .

Credit : Kathleen Malone-Van Dyke <p> For Noah Syndergaard , now is probably the best time for a terrible injury . If he was going to need Tommy John surgery eventually -- within baseball circles , there was a feeling of inevitability regarding the ripped 6-6 flamethrower and a torn ulnar collateral ligament -- it might as well be during an abbreviated season , as this one will be because of the coronavirus pandemic . <p> So Syndergaard will have surgery Thursday , on what was supposed to be Opening Day , and begin his year-plus rehabilitation by missing something less than a normal 162-game slate ( plus a portion of 2021 ) . The timing is suboptimal from a business perspective , because he is scheduled to be a free agent after the 2021 season , but he is young enough and talented enough that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . <p> But for the Mets ? Missing Syndergaard this year , of all years , has the potential to be particularly painful for two reasons : their minimal rotation depth and the unusual schedule we might see once baseball resumes . <p> To address the depth first : The Mets ' hypothetical contention this year is built largely on their excellence during the second half of last season ( 46-26 ) . But now they are looking at substituting Rick Porcello and Michael Wacha in the current rotation for Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler from that rotation . That is a potential ace No. 2 starter and a guy who had a 2.83 ERA after the All-Star break last year replaced by a pair of veterans who have been injured or ineffective or both in recent seasons . <p> Beyond the top five , you have the likes of Walker Lockett , Corey Oswalt , David Peterson and Erasmo Ramirez ( a non-roster invitee with 92 major-league starts of experience who impressed manager Luis Rojas in his audition for a long-reliever/swingman role before spring training was halted ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series , they benefited from strong debut seasons from Syndergaard and Steven Matz . There are n't any similar majors-ready pitching prospects in the pipeline , though Peterson , a first-round pick in 2017 , has a chance . The closest the Mets could have come were a pair of Long Islanders , Justin Dunn and Anthony Kay , who were part of the Edwin Diaz/Robinson Cano and Marcus Stroman trades , respectively , by general manager Brodie Van Wagenen . Dunn ( Mariners ) and Kay ( Blue Jays ) made their major-league debuts with their new teams last season . <p> Aftereffects of the coronavirus delay might make that depth matter more than usual . It is true that , because of the shortened schedule , the Mets wo n't need to replace all of Syndergaard 's would-be 32 starts . But as Major League Baseball and the players ' union figure out what the season will look like -- nobody knows when it will start -- among the adjustments reportedly under consideration are fewer days off and more doubleheaders , in an effort to play as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip into their rotation depth more frequently , which would not bode well for the Mets . <p> Eventually , teams will set their Opening Day rosters , which will result in some players being cut , which will result in Van Wagenen and his front office going through the usual rigmarole of deciding who is available and who might be worth adding . But do n't plan on finding answers there . The quality of pitcher available during that time will be worse than usual , with teams hyperaware of the need for depth ( and potentially carrying more pitchers than usual if 26-man rosters are expanded to account for the odd " spring " training ) . <p> Subscribe to Newsday 's sports newsletter <p> Receive stories , photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events .

@@51657741 <h> How people are passing their time during self-isolation with kooky facial hair , stick-and-poke tattoos , hair dye and more . <p> Some of us are using lockdown as an opportunity to shave our heads , beef with our flatmates or pick up smoking again ( what better way to relax during a respiratory virus pandemic than with a delicious cigarette ? ) . But as self-isolation grinds on with no end in sight , more and more people are taking the opportunity to alter their appearance in ever more creative ways . Whether this is done in a spirit of care-free experimentation or existential anguish depends entirely on the person . <p> I spoke to a bunch of people expressing their extreme psychic distress -- or simply having a laugh -- through DIY tattoos , dye jobs , facial hair and more . <h> Bleached Eyebrows <p> Sehir is a photographer for the NHS , so , unlike many of us , ca n't work from home . But she recently spent what should have been a two-week holiday in Italy stuck inside her flat , which is when her curiosity began . " I have dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face , " she says . " I 've always wondered what I would look like without them . That 's when the bleach came out . " <p> Sehir describes the reception from colleagues as mostly amusement , and was flattered to be told it looked " Bowie-esque " . " It 's quite amusing to watch people 's reactions , many of which have been why ! ? ! " <p> On the plus side , her friends and family who 've seen the new look on Zoom have all responded well , including Sehir 's mum -- which came as a pleasant surprise . As a key worker , Sehir 's life is pretty stressful at the moment , and experimenting with her appearance has helped her to unwind . " I find a sense of release in different forms of creative expression , " she says , " and that includes my style . I 've learned that the old saying about blondes is true : I 'm having fun with my bleached brows !

The other one , on my wrist , ' 1945 ' , refers to the year my gran was born . I 've wanted both of these for a while but did n't feel like waiting until tattoo shops reopen . Plus , I begrudge paying over ? 60 for such small pieces of text . Using my own stick-and-poke stuff was just too tempting . " <p> Giving herself these tattoos helped make Jemma 's time under lockdown more bearable . " I 've found that being in self-isolation has given me far too much time to be in my head , overthinking absolutely anything , " she says . " But these tattoos have completely lifted my spirits in the same way I imagine more conventional ' self-care ' would . But then again , body modification has always made me happier -- so I really think it depends on who you are .

Every cheerless " virtual pub " session I 've attended so far has boasted at least one man who 's taken his lockdown beard too far and ended up looking like a cross between the Unabomber and an Amish serial killer . But for Joseph , a copywriter based in Leeds , experimenting with his facial hair was a considered decision , rather than a lethargic descent into self-neglect . <p> " I already had a bit of a stubble thing going on , but I always fancied a moustache , " he says . " Moustaches and beards always look shit during the in-between growing stage , so lockdown seemed like a perfect opportunity to cultivate a strong ' tache . Coincidentally , a few of my friends from university had the same idea , so we 've been comparing them on our weekly Zoom quiz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine is the strongest . " <p> You 'll be relieved to learn that the reaction from Joseph 's friends , family and fiance has largely been positive -- he 's been compared to everything from a New York City cop to a young Mario . " Both of those I can live with , " he says . Although Joseph is n't sure whether he 's going to keep it up after self-isolation ends , he considers the experience a positive one . " I 'd recommend growing a moustache to any man during lockdown -- even if your facial hair could be licked off by a kitten , " he says . " Turning your face into a novelty item brings a vague feeling of joy , and ultimately , no one is going to see it anyway . Crack on . " <h> Haircuts <p> Sadly , not everyone is as enthused about their lockdown makeovers as Jemma and Joseph . After giving herself a hasty DIY mullet , Carla was overcome with a feeling of profound regret . " It looks shit ! " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't mind , but when I decided to give myself the mullet I instantly realised I 'd made a mistake . I do still want one , actually -- just one that looks nice and is done by a professional . " <p> What advice does she have to stop other amateur hairdressers from following in her unfortunate footsteps ? " Do n't cut or dye your hair in quarantine unless it 's something you usually do in your everyday life . Yeah , you wo n't have to face other people with your ugly new haircut , but you can easily spend all day staring at it in the mirror . " <h> Hair Dye <p> One person who is unambiguously delighted with their new lockdown locks , however , is fashion blogger Tif ? : last week , she shaved then bleached her hair in what was a long and painful yet ultimately satisfying process . " I was just bored out of my mind , logging into Zoom , logging out of Zoom , " she says , " so I started doing other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . " <p> Changing her hairstyle came from the same desire to use her time well and not let the lockdown experience go to waste . " I thought , ' If I 'm going to be bored , I might as well do something different . If it works , it works . If it does n't , I 'm not going anywhere anyway . ' " <p> The only downside is that she likes her new aesthetic so much she regrets the fact she ca n't properly show it off : " Although , when I 'm going to the shops , I try to wear outfits that will complement my hair .

On the one hand , given the grandparents ' age and health status , it could be the last time the whole family gets together this way , and the event brings them joy . On the other , elderly family members are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 . Plus , one couple has a newborn and another is pregnant ; the risks for them are unclear . <p> " No one 's sure what the right thing is to do , " Kelly Thomas , a lawyer in New York City , told Insider . <p> As states begin to open restaurants , beaches , and workplaces to varying degrees , many people like Thomas are asking themselves new questions about what 's safe : Go to the family gathering or settle for Zoom ? Send kids back to preschool or keep them home ? ( That , of course , comes on top of the tough decisions that are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Unfortunately , nothing is 100% risk-free , and what experts know continues to change . Throw in evolving and false information , humans ' propensity for cognitive error , and the judgment-clouding stress of living through a pandemic , and day-to-day life gets exhausting fast . <p> That wo n't end any time soon . <p> But infectious-disease and psychology experts agree on a few effective ways to assess risk and make good-enough decisions without going mad . <h> First , understand the factors that distinguish low- and high-risk situations <p> source <p> Crystal Cox/Business Insider <p> The first step is to understand the general principles that make something high- or low-risk . <p> " This virus really likes people being indoors in an enclosed space for prolonged periods of close face-to-face contact , " William Schaffner , an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University , previously told Insider . <p> That 's because the coronavirus typically spreads via droplets that jump up to 6 feet between people . <p> So it 's not surprising that your risk of infection is probably lower outside than indoors . One preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer-reviewed ) suggested that the odds that an infected person " transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment . " <p> Still , that does n't mean people can safely congregate in the park or on the beach . No matter where you are , everyone should stay at least 6 feet apart . <p> According to Schaffner , the most important thing to consider when evaluating an activity or a place is how well you can social distance . <p> Another factor is how well ventilated a space is . Scientists still are n't certain to what degree a cloud of tiny coronavirus particles -- known as aerosols -- can linger in the air and infect the next person who walks by . But research has suggested that more live viral particles are found in the air in enclosed rooms with little airflow . <p> Doug Hassebroek picks up an item at the grocery store , separated from cashiers by sheets of plexiglass installed as a precautionary measure , during the outbreak of coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in Brooklyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> source <p> Caitlin Ochs/Reuters <p> Lastly , Schaffner suggests minimizing how long you spend in an indoor space that 's not your home . <p> The worst coronavirus clusters around the US have been tied to places that force people into close quarters for extended periods , like nursing homes , correctional facilities , and meatpacking plants . <p> " The farther away you are and the shorter duration of contact between you and other people means you get less efficient virus transmission , " Schaffner said . <h> Then , consider your values and priorities <p> Once you have a grasp on the practical risks associated with various activities , consider what you value about them rather than what you fear could happen if you pursue them , Julie Pike , a clinical psychologist in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , told Insider . <p> " Focusing the whole time on what could happen to us during the activity defeats the purpose , " she said . " Instead , focus on why you are leaving the house -- for example , ' I am seeing my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family .

Pre-coronavirus , they saw each other at least every other day . <p> After five weeks working from home while caring for a toddler , Neidich and her husband had had it . The four adults compared their definitions of social distancing , and agreed to see each other but to otherwise only leave their houses for essential trips . While not all states and counties support this sort of isolation-cell setup , ultimately , the family felt the benefits to their mental health were worth it . <p> " I just can not tell you the positive impact it has had for all of us , " Neidich told Insider . <h> source <h> FamVeld/Getty Images <h> Make the small choices habits to beat decision fatigue <p> While some decisions like what to do for July 4th are only made once , others like whether to wear a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor ones , you 'll have less mental capacity for the bigger ones , and make worse choices overall . <p> " We are drawing from a single well , and when you deplete it in one domain there 's less left over in another domain , " Dr. Mimi Winsberg , a psychiatrist and chief medical officer at the mental health telemedicine service Brightside , told Insider . <p> " Once we have it down , we do n't have to question it , " Winsberg said . " It 's the questioning that causes the fatigue . " <h> Create your own ' fear schedule ' <p> There 's still a whole lot experts do n't know about the coronavirus , and that alone " really messes with us , because we ca n't run the math on risk , and then there 's too many choices and then we get paralyzed , " Kate Bowler , an associate professor at Duke Divinity School , recently said on the Happier podcast . <p> To manage that , every two weeks , she does an in-depth catch-up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal risk as a cancer survivor , and decides what behaviors to keep or change for the two weeks going forward . <p> Setting this " fear schedule , " as she calls it , allows her to not constantly worry ; she simply chooses to be comfortable with a set of decisions for a period of time . <p> " We have to live with the story of the choices we made , " she said . " In the future , something might happen and we did n't know , but we also need to have said , ' We could n't have known . " ' <p> source <p> Getty <p> Bowler 's approach to the news aligns with advice from many experts , who recommend limiting your consumption and sticking to a few trusted sources . <p> While it can seem like information about what 's risky changes by the minute , the reality is that " reliable information accumulates very , very slowly , " Baruch Fischhoff , a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University and expert in risk assessment , told Insider .

Heimrich told IPE . <p> Due to BVK 's overall diversification strategy , the recent high losses on the stock market " have only had a small impact " , he said , without providing figures . <p> Investments in real estate and bonds with a good credit rating have ensured that , so far , the overall decline in market values have not jeopardised the interest rate for 2020 . <p> " It is important to avoid cluster risks and to react quickly to market developments depending on the situation , " Heimrich added . <p> However , he said , it is still uncertain whether the current crisis may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment strategy . <p> While investments in securities can continue without limit based on existing investment mandates , " planned real estate investments may experience delays in new acquisitions due to a change in general conditions caused by the coronavirus crisis " , Heimrich said . <p> There are signs that some institutional investors are seeking to support ailing domestic companies . <p> AMF , the second largest pension fund in Sweden , said it is ready to invest billions over 2020 in local companies it views as long-term investments , and has earmarked up to SEK5bn ( ? 548m ) as a first step in supporting Sweden 's commerce through the COVID-19 crisis . <p> The SEK650bn pension fund said it would put money into the businesses in the form of new equity , beginning by working with companies in which it was currently a long-term owner , but said it was also open to buying new shares in conjunction with their existing shareholders and other investors . <p> Tomas Flod ? n , AMF 's chief investment officer , said : " As a major owner , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our good and long-term viable companies remain , and are competitive even when the pandemic is over . " <p> AMF said that historically , the default providers in Sweden 's occupational pension system had succeeded in bridging periods of asset price declines because they had been able to invest in different asset types -- such as property and infrastructure -- based on their long-term ability to generate returns . <p> Investors urge pharmas to fight against virus <p> A group of Dutch and international investors -- representing ? 1.9trn in total assets -- has urged the pharmaceutical industry to join forces in the fight against COVID-19 . <p> The group , with a membership exceeding 40 asset managers , pension funds and insurers , said in an investor statement that there were currently too many individual initiatives , and unfortunately priority is " being given to short-term financial and competitive considerations , and this hinders the optimal action against the virus " . <p> " This group of engaged shareholders believes that right now financial considerations should take second place in the global challenge of getting the coronavirus under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ? 179bn Dutch asset manager , which initiated the appeal . <p> In the statement , the group urged pharmaceutical companies to look after the health of their workers , and to ensure their supply chains remain active in order to provide medical professionals access to healthcare products and equipment , including personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . <p> The investors highlighted that the pharmaceutical sector 's main responsibility was developing and providing affordable access to healthcare products , including diagnostics , medication and vaccines . <p> " Enforcing patents , excessive price-fixing , withholding relevant findings as well as demanding extensive market exclusivity should not conflict this responsibility .

Their appeal is addressed to more than 15 large pharmaceutical companies around the world , such as Roche , Gilead and Johnson &amp; Johnson . <p> Leen Preesman <p> " For our pension savers , it is important that we ensure that the value that exists in these companies remains and grows over one , two and 20-year periods , " said Flod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the pandemic is over , he said , adding that AMF had a responsibility to ensure that its customers ' pensions were invested in firms that had long-term potential . <p> The pension fund , which is run on mutual principles said it had continued to invest despite recent market turbulence . <p> Recent deals included the increase of its equity stake in Swedish Hotel chain Scandic Hotels to 15% , AMF said , a SEK140m investment in Swedish wind power company Stena Renewable for the firm 's expansion , and a SEK280m investment in Swedish online supermarket MatHem . <p> The coverage ratios of Dutch pension funds could drop to below 70% if the crisis is lengthy , according to Willis Towers Watson ( WTW ) . <p> They could still bounce back to the level of 2019-end next year if the crisis turns out to be short , WTW said after assessing three scenarios . <p> The most optimistic of these assumes that the virus is brought under control before July , and that government support for households and companies turns out to be effective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring in the third quarter , combined with a worldwide recession , as well as a continuing low turnover for European and US companies in 2020 . <p> In WTW 's worst-case scenario , consumer confidence in Chinese exports will recover slowly , while unemployment in Europe and the US soars and companies go bust as a result of reduced financing options and credit facilities . <p> The main difference between the first and the second scenarios , which both include new COVID-19 cases in the third quarter , is the period that governments and banks need to support the economy , WTW said . <p> " Unless the social affairs ' minister Wouter Koolmees grants another leeway , this will lead to a reduction of pension rights and benefits at the pension funds with a consecutive funding shortfall in the past five years . " <p> Crisis leads to calls for early withdrawal <p> The COVID-19 crisis has reignited a debate in Austria over the long-term severance pay saving system , with a call for early withdrawals . <p> Wolfgang Katzian , president of the country 's Trade Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal of assets before the 36 month minimum period that applies under the current rule in cases of lost employment . <p> Under the Abfertigung Neu severance pay system , employers pay 1.53% of the gross salary from the second month of employment . <p> At the end of 2018 , some 3.5 million Austrians had saved ? 11.5bn in severance pay accounts with eight providers of betriebliche Vorsorgekassen . <p> Providers must offer a guarantee equal to the gross amount of contributions made and a maximum of 40% can be invested in equities . <p> However , the occupational severance pay funds umbrella group , Plattform der Betrieblichen Vorsorgekassen , said the ? GB 's proposal could be acceptable on the basis of a compromise that would include extending of the time the money remains in the accounts . <p> Across the globe , over 800,000 Australian pension savers have requested early release of part of their superannuation savings to tide them over the economic shutdown . <p> The number is double the account holders ( 361,000 ) who have accessed their savings prematurely over the past five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or A$2.9bn in total . <p> The nation 's largest super fund , AustralianSuper , expects to receive requests -- through the Australian Taxation Office , which is tasked with processing requests -- from over 300,000 members . <p> Such is demand for early release that questions have been raised about the ability of funds to meet obligations . There have been suggestions that the government might have to issue bonds to create liquidity . <p> Some conservative politicians blame the cash squeeze on industry funds for having invested in illiquid assets , such as infrastructure . <p> Luigi Serenelli &amp; Florence Chong <p> In the worldwide recession scenario , coverage ratio of Dutch pension funds would have recovered to approximately 95% on average at the end of 2021 , which is still about 10 percentage points short of the 2019 level . <p> The most extreme scenario assumes new hits on equity markets and long-term low interest rates . <p> In the UK , the aggregate deficit of defined benefit ( DB ) schemes potentially eligible for entry to the Pension Protection Fund ( PPF ) is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? 135.9bn over March , the PPF announced in April . <p> This is equivalent to a fall in the funding ratio from 93.2% at the end of February to 92.5% at the end of March . <p> There were 114 more schemes in deficit at the end of March than a month previously , according to the new PPF figures . The shortfall of the schemes in deficit grew ? 9.3bn , from ? 244.8bn at the end of February to ? 254.1bn . <p> The change in the deficiency of schemes in deficit on a so-called section 179 basis is an illustration of the impact of changes in financial markets on the PPF 's total exposure . <p> A scheme 's s179 liabilities represent the premium that would have to be paid to an insurance company to take on the payment of PPF-levels of compensation . Schemes in surplus on an s179 basis at the time of insolvency usually do not enter the DB lifeboat fund . <p> A spokesperson for the ? 32bn PPF said the drop in schemes ' funding position over March was caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was partially offset by a decrease in liability values of about 1.6% due to an increase in index-linked bond yields . <p> Sion Cole , head of UK fiduciary business at BlackRock , said that since the start of the year funding levels have fallen 5.5% . " However , the variation around these figures will be significant , depending on the size of a scheme 's equity and credit allocations and amount of liability hedging , " he said . <p> " In short , it 's been a torrid start to the year for pension schemes and the volatility does not look set to disappear anytime soon . " <p> In April , the PPF said the COVID-19 outbreak was causing " daily changes to the way we work " . <p> Commenting on the fund 's business plan for 2020-21 , PPF chief executive officer Oliver Morley added : " The extent of the impact is , of course , unknown at this stage .

It has temporarily cancelled on-site investigations . <p> The DNB added that pension funds must put in a maximum effort to obtain pension premiums from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emphasised that pension rights will remain if contributions are not paid , and a two-month leeway is legally possible . <p> At the launch of DNB 's annual report last month , Bos said the supervisor , the cabinet and industry organisations were discussing options in case of a continued crisis . " The question is whether and how the government 's emergency measures apply to employers ' premium payments , " she said . <p> The Dutch pension funds for the building , metal and cleaning sectors , hairdressers , hospitality workers , the travel industry and the retail sector have granted their affiliated employers leeway in paying their pension contributions . <p> The ? 67bn pension fund for the building industry ( BpfBOUW ) said that , in order to ease the pressure on employers , it had extended the term of payment until 1 June . <p> PMT and PME , the country 's pension funds for the metal sector , said they had also allowed affiliated employers to delay their contributions . <p> PME has granted a two-month leeway , while PMT allowed for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that tailored arrangements were possible for struggling firms . <p> PME said that its goal is to enable companies to easily apply a reduction of working hours , thereby improving their liquidity . <p> It added that it assumed that the government 's financial support will also offer a solution for the payment of pension premiums . <p> Peter Borgdorff , director of the ? 238bn healthcare scheme PFZW , added that about 200 employers were facing difficulties . He said that , instead of a general payment deferment , his scheme will assess requests case by case . <p> In the UK , more than 500 companies are likely to use new regulatory flexibilities and delay making pension deficit repair contributions ( DRCs ) according to a report from consultancy LCP in late April . <p> It estimated that about ? 500m ( ? 565m ) in total will be held back . <p> There have already been media reports that firms such as retailers Arcadia and Debenhams have sought to delay making DRCs . LCP says its analysis is the first industry-wide estimate of how widespread such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of data on more than 200 schemes for which it acts as an adviser . <p> This led to an estimate that at least 10% of sponsoring employers were likely to delay making contributions for at least three months . <p> Pension funds have had to adapt to social distancing working for operations such as trading while other staff have stayed at home . <p> In the Netherlands , some 100 of APG 's critical staff were still working in company offices last month . They represent people working in ICT , treasury and trading , as well as benefits payments .

" during a global pandemic might seem absurd . Every day the news gets grimmer . We hear sirens outside our windows . We read stories of hospitals stretched to capacity . Loved ones are sick . We ca n't leave our homes . Finding things to be grateful for right now might seem impossible . But studies show the healing power of gratitude . Feeling and expressing thanks can improve our well-being . What 's more important during the COVID-19 pandemic than that ? <p> Spend a few minutes every day writing a list of reasons why you are grateful . For example : I am grateful for my health and for my family 's health . I am grateful for the nurses and doctors working hard to save lives . I am grateful for the love I have in my life . I am grateful the sun is shining today . I also recommend reading , listening , or watching things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neighbors in Spain and Italy making music from their balconies , and puppies exploring an aquarium . <p> If you 're feeling afraid right now , that 's okay . Anxiety can harm our emotional health , but sometimes it 's necessary , and a little bit of fear can be beneficial . Anxiety tells us that we need to be alert . And we do need to be alert right now . When we leave our homes , we need to remember to put six feet of space between other people and ourselves , not to touch our faces , and to wash our hands frequently . A little watchfulness right now is fine as long as it does n't overwhelm us . <p> We 've known for a long time about the connection between mental and physical health .

Wake up at the same time every morning , go to bed at the same time every night , and fill your day with activities , including work , hobbies , solo time , and family time . Keeping your home tidy can also decrease your feelings of stress . The less chaos around you , the more at peace you will feel . Write a list of the things in your home for which you are grateful . For example : I am grateful for the food in my cupboards . I am grateful for my books . I am grateful for the tree outside my window . <p> At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. have orders to stay at home . There are things to be grateful for in this situation , too . If your home includes a partner , children , or roommates , and you ca n't find as much time or space to enjoy alone time as you 'd like , people who are socially isolating solo might appear to have it easier . For those that live alone , social isolation can feel very , well , isolating . You imagine how much nicer it would be to live with family or friends right now . The grass is always greener , right ? Whatever your living situation , write a list of the things for which you feel gratitude . For example : I am grateful for my pet . I am grateful I get to spend more time with my family . I am grateful for my own space . <p> For those socially isolating solo , feelings of loneliness and disconnection can increase depression and anxiety , so carve out time in your day to connect with friends and family through FaceTime , Skype , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carve out at least one hour every day to relax alone , and remember your partner/kids/roommates need solo time , too .

Journal , write poetry , paint , draw , make a collage , play music , or try your hand at a new dish in the kitchen . Write a list of the first things you 're going to do when the stay-at-home orders are lifted . Where do you want to visit ? Who do you want to see ? At which restaurants do you want to eat ? <p> There is beauty in the world , even in our darkest hours , and many reasons to feel gratitude .

@@31749241 <p> CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Cleveland Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff was at home on that life-altering Wednesday night . The Cavs had lost to the Bulls in Chicago a night earlier and Bickerstaff wanted to spend one last evening with his wife Nikki and three kids before embarking on a 10-day road trip that was set to begin with a flight to Charlotte the next day . <p> That 's when he heard the rattling news . Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 , the first known case in the NBA . <p> Bickerstaff , stunned at first , grabbed his phone and texted a few of his friends on the Utah Jazz staff . Then came the aftershock . The NBA moved quickly , announcing that the remainder of the season had been suspended . <p> " It was a surprise , " Bickerstaff told cleveland.com . " Basketball -- and sports in general -- goes on . There are so many things that have happened -- tragedies around the world , Mother Nature , acts of God , whatever it may be -- and sports goes on . That 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the severity of the issue . <p> " What I think is even more important is how people view the NBA as a whole and their ability to forward-think in these situations . ( NBA Commissioner ) Adam Silver and the crew had the courage to be the first league to stop or postpone the season and it speaks to what our league is about and how quality the leadership of our league is . " <p> Later that night , Bickerstaff was able to FaceTime one of his buddies , who was in the Jazz locker room waiting to be tested . <p> At that point , many things raced through his mind . Whether his friends were OK . His own health , considering the Cavs had played the Jazz in Cleveland on March 2 . His players . His family . The unknown about the rest of the regular season . Since then , everything has moved so fast and yet so slow all at the same time . <p> Bickerstaff has n't been tested for coronavirus . No one in the Cavaliers organization has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I do n't feel any effects . My kids are good . My wife is good . I feel like the people who need the test should use the test and they should be the ones getting tested , " Bickerstaff said . " At this point , I 'm comfortable with where we are and the steps that we have taken to protect ourselves . " <p> It 's been about three weeks since the Cavaliers ' last game -- a 108-103 loss that pushed them to 19-46 overall and 5-6 since Bickerstaff took over for John Beilein . <p> By all accounts , the Bickerstaff era had gotten off to a promising start . The Cavs had a trio of wins against playoff teams -- Denver , Miami and Philadelphia . They were much more competitive , exhibiting a selfless style . Bickerstaff was starting to see growth in late-game situations . He had even finalized a new multi-year deal , officially making him the head coach through 2023-24 . After a tumultuous season , there was a feeling of ease inside the locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive test , everything changed . <p> There are deeper concerns . Health , safety , quality of life . More important things to consider . But there are also 17 games on the Cavs ' schedule . Bickerstaff was hoping to capitalize on that time . He still is . <p> " I would hope to play the final 17 games , to be honest with you , " he said . " Where we are and how important that is to us as a team in building and the taste it can leave as we go into what would have been a summer break -- guys wanting to go out , work , prepare and get better because they start to see some things heading in the right direction . That momentum I think was going to be and would be important for us . <p> " The toughest thing in this league is learning how to win and we were starting to get to the point in fourth quarters . So , for us as a group , that 's meaningful . Obviously the league will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans , but for us , I would love to have those games . " <p> Does Bickerstaff , who has been in the NBA since 2004 , have any guess on what will happen ? <p> " Not at all . I know they will be relentless in their effort to do what 's best by everybody , " Bickerstaff said . " By everybody , it 's not just the teams that are involved , but all of our fans . Sports have always been a release for everybody . You have a tough day at work or whatever , you can come home , watch the Cavs and lose yourself for two and a half hours in that . This point in time , with all the stuff going on , I think it would speak volumes when it gets back . I think it will be a celebration . Make a huge impact on people 's lives . " <p> For now , he 's still bunkered inside his lakefront home alongside his family . He 's been in touch with doctors and medical personnel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a broader understanding of the virus , the timeline , symptoms and any exposure concerns . <p> Like many of his players , Bickerstaff has turned his focus toward helping . About a week ago , he donated an unspecified amount to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank and Children 's Hunger Alliance . <p> " It 's something that my wife and I have always kind of had a passion for , " Bickerstaff said . " Having kids of my own , there 's nothing that would pain me more than to see kids having to go without food . That starts everything , right ? If you do n't have food , you go to school and your mind is not focused because you 're hungry and then you ca n't exercise because you do n't have the energy . <p> " Just trying to figure out a way where we could help as much as possible and then with a focus on kids being able to take meals home or have meals delivered , I think that was a thing that was most important . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bickerstaff 's typical day starts with home-schooling in the morning . Then there 's an afternoon workout , lunch , film and phone calls -- with his coaching staff , players , friends , out-of-town family . <p> He thinks staying connected during this time is vital . He has also devoted an hour each day to what he calls " P.E . time " that he runs for his kids , hoping to keep them active and engaged . According to Bickerstaff , his wife handles most of the other activities . <p> " It 's been good , " Bickerstaff said . " Just being able to spend time with them every day is different for us considering what we are used to doing with the travel and stuff . " <p> On the table is a 1,000-piece puzzle that is in the early stages of completion . There 's no rush to finish . This stoppage seems like it will last a while . <p> The other night , Bickerstaff watched The Banker -- a movie about two African-American entrepreneurs who hire a working-class white man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pose as a janitor and chauffeur . <p> " Really good movie , " Bickerstaff said . " I would recommend that to everybody . " <p> He also just started Tiger King on Netflix . <p> " We 're like three episodes in , " he said while laughing . " So far , it 's been entertaining . " <p> The only time he gets in his car : To make a trip to the nearby car wash . He has n't even been to the grocery store . He 's used to being at the practice facility or an NBA arena . He 's grown accustomed to having face-to-face , in-person contact with his players . But this situation does n't allow for that . <p> So , he 's replaced those moments with daily text messages , FaceTime or Zoom calls . He joked that most of the time players answer while sporting gaming headsets . Bickerstaff passes along information for guys to read , some sports-related , some not . He sends TED Talk videos . He recently opened a massive group text with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cavs ' recent surge , ca n't be lost just because games are n't being played and facilities are shuttered . <p> " It 's more about the personal stuff now , " he said . " I 've talked to our coaching staff and have them preparing different projects . They can talk more about the basketball-specific stuff with the guys and then my thing is looking at the big picture and trying to still lay the foundation of the environment and culture that we are trying to cultivate here . ... Then , whatever we can do extra , the organization is willing to do extra . <p> " My conversations are very little basketball . It 's more about how they 're doing , how they 're handling things , what are they doing , who are they with and those types of things . " <p> Through the help of the team 's strength and conditioning guys , Bickerstaff is also trying to make sure everyone stays ready . The training staff has put together videos and written up plans . There are even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water jugs as dumbbells . He has a Peloton ( and was perturbed that he did n't finish in the top 1,000 riders on his first day ) . Collin Sexton has gone for bike rides and found his way onto a court . Some players have more access to workout equipment than others . If guys need something to stay in shape , the Cavs have sent it . <p> " Obviously not being able to have all the equipment makes it a little more difficult , but our strength guys have done an unbelievable job of putting stuff together to keep guys in the best possible shape physically , but I also think it helps guys mentally too , " Bickerstaff said . <p> " We 're fortunate that we work with really bright people and in the beginning they told us this could be fluid and every single day it could possibly change . We never had long-term expectations . The more we communicate it makes things ... I wo n't say easier overall , but easier for us to handle . "

@@31754141 <h> How the coronavirus could contribute to a 2020 election meltdown . <p> The November 2020 presidential election wo n't be run perfectly -- we have never had a perfect election conducted in this country or elsewhere -- but the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic add special stress to what was already going to be a difficult election and underline the need to ensure that it is run in a way that maximizes both voter access and integrity . Even before the current crisis , I had been deeply concerned about the chances of a 2020 " election meltdown , " in which the 47 percent or more of the population on the losing side would not accept the results as legitimate . I am even more worried now because of the changes and shortcuts that will be necessary to successfully run November 's tally amid a pandemic . Here is what we need to do to minimize the chances of a November meltdown . <p> The pre-COVID-19 status of Americans ' trust in elections was already troubling . Recent pollingshowed that many Americans worried that votes would not be fairly and accurately counted , with potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my recent book , Election Meltdown , four factors contribute to declining trust in elections . First , Republican legislatures have passed voter ID and other laws making it harder to register and vote , but the kind of voter fraud these laws are supposedly intended to prevent is so small that Democrats can only conclude that these laws were passed to shrink the field of likely Democratic voters . The voter fraud/voter suppression framing of American election administration convinces everyone that the other side is trying to cheat to win . Second , small pockets of election administrator incompetence get outsize attention during close elections . Political actors like President Donald Trump , meanwhile , seek to capitalize on mistakes of incompetent election administrators like Broward County , Florida 's Brenda Snipes -- who resigned after the 2018 midterm election following a series of blunders -- and portray these failures as attempts to rig or steal an election . Third , dirtytricks continue to proliferate in American elections . Finally , partisans have ratcheted up the rhetoric of " stolen " or " rigged " elections , almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter access and integrity . <p> The current public health crisis is only likely to increase the strains on voter confidence . In its massive economic aid package that was signed into law on Friday , Congress is providing only $400 million for states to deal with expected increased costs associated with running the election during the outbreak , a woefully inadequate amount given the Brennan Center for Justice 's $2 billion estimate for additional needs . Congress rejected Democrats ' attempts to require states to offer a no-excuse vote-by-mail option in November for the one-third of the states that still require voters to offer an excuse to vote from home . <p> The lack of federal funding may negatively affect voter confidence in a few ways . First , if the pandemic is still limiting our ability to move freely about society in the fall , the amount of absentee balloting is going to explode whether Congress mandates an expansion of absentee balloting or not . We have already seen the huge growth in absentee ballot requests for Wisconsin 's April 7 primary , along with legal challenges surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important step in ensuring that even if the virus keeps people away from physical polling places , millions of Americans will have a means of avoiding disenfranchisement . But it is not perfect . <p> Vote-by-mail ballots are more likely to be rejected than other ballots because of problems like signature mismatches . We also know that rejection rates for signature mismatches can disproportionately affect minority voters . Some states do not alert a voter whose ballot has been rejected about the rejection , failing to give the voter a chance to cure something like a purported signature mismatch . Signature matching is also a notoriously subjective endeavor . Even before the coronavirus pandemic , the issue has led to litigation over whether those voters are being unconstitutionally denied their right to vote . Some disabled voters , meanwhile , may need to vote at physical polling places because they lack the physical ability to fill out a ballot at home . These voters too risk disenfranchisement . And in the 11 states without online voter registration , even registering to vote in time for the election may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining only limited hours . <p> Further , some jurisdictions are going to be overwhelmed with the number of absentee ballots to process , whether because of the lack of scanners or workers . There will be stories of notoriously bad election administration in November because we have some election offices in the country with poor leadership and inadequate resources -- problems that will only be exacerbated by the stress of conducting an election under these conditions . Those stories will fit into a " stolen election " narrative , one likely egged on by Russians or others seeking to sow discord and undermine faith in our election . This will be on top of potential virus-related misinformation aimed at particular communities warning them against showing up to vote or telling them to vote at the wrong place or time . <p> Even worse , the need to process millions more absentee ballots without adequate funds and training means November 's election results could well be delayed . This is especially worrying in Detroit and Philadelphia because both cities have a history of poor election administration , and both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-excuse absentee balloting -- and both states play a critical role in the outcome of the Electoral College that determines the presidency . Delay is going to lead to cries of fraud , when in fact good election administration -- especially when dealing with absentee ballots -- takes time . <p> What if Trump is ahead in Michigan and Pennsylvania on election night and he declares victory , but after millions of absentee ballots are processed a week or so later Biden is declared the winner in those states and wins the election ? Will Republicans believe Trump if he claimed the later count was the result of fraud , despite all evidence to the contrary ? <p> Meanwhile , when election fraud -- as rare as it is -- does actually happen in the United States , about a quarter of the time it is because of absentee ballot tampering . In some states it is legal for people to collect an unlimited number of completed absentee ballots from other voters , and that raises the danger not only of fraud but of folks on the wrong side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fraud that led the North Carolina state elections board to require a do-over of the 2018 race for the state 's 9th Congressional District involved the collection and tampering of such absentee ballots . Already we are seeing the usual suspects on the right raise concerns that voter fraud will be rampant with increased vote by mail . Last week , for instance , Republican Rep. Thomas Massie ( the same guy who objected to a voice vote on the federal coronavirus bill and made a majority of House members return to D.C. for a vote ) tweeted , " Universal vote by mail would be the end of our republic as we know it . " <p> So what can we do about this greater potential for a meltdown in November ? The two keys are resources and state-mandated improvements in administration . We know that the election is going to be much more expensive , and we know where many of the problems are . <p> If Congress is not going to step up , states need to find money in their already strained budgets to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert more authority over local jurisdictions to manage the expected surge in absentee balloting , the added expenses of running polling places consistent with stringent health requirements , and other potential threats to the election like cyberattacks . Too much local control in election administration is a recipe for disaster because in a close election everyone will look at the small number of places where things failed , not the vast majority of places that manage to conduct a single election well . State legislatures need to give state election administrators more power over poorly performing election offices . States also need to advertise and impose heavy penalties on those who would tamper with absentee ballots , especially if states send absentee ballots to all registered voters ( some of whom may have moved or died ) . <p> Already the stress on election administrators in 2020 was high . The virus is likely to be the greatest challenge yet . But we need to ensure that as many people as possible who are on the losing end of the 2020 election believe that it was conducted fairly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to regroup and agree to fight again for public support in the next election cycle . The health of our democracy , even during the time of the coronavirus , depends on it . <p> For more on the impact of the coronavirus , listen to the latest episode of Amicus.

Those practicing social distancing due to Covid-19 may not get that any time soon . " Open , transparent , consistent communication is the most important thing governments and organizations can do : Make sure people understand why they are being quarantined first and foremost , how long it is expected to last , " says Samantha Brooks , who has studied the psychological impact of quarantine at King 's College London . " A huge factor in the negative psychological impact seems to be confusion about what 's going on , not having clear guidelines , or getting different messages from different organizations .

Harry Taylor , who studies social isolation in older adults , particularly in the black community , says that it 's one of the worst things that humans can do to their overall well-being , adding that " the mortality effect of social isolation is like smoking 15 cigarettes per day . " In older people , social isolation seems to exacerbate any preexisting medical conditions , from cardiovascular diseases to Alzheimer 's , but its ill effects are n't limited to those over 60 . <p> Alexander Chouker , a physician researcher who studies stress immunology at the University of Munich , has seen radical changes in the bodies of people participating in simulations of manned spaceflight missions like Mars-500 . " They were young and trained people not in a condition of real threat , " he says . " The pure fact of being confined affects the body . If you change your environment in a quite extreme way , it is changing you . " Participants , some of whom were only isolated for three months , experienced changes to their sleep , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alterations to their metabolisms . " Being confined and isolated affects the human physiology as a whole , " Chouker says . <p> Does this mean your body will go wonky like an astronaut trapped on fake Mars for over a year ? Not necessarily . You probably are n't truly socially isolated , at least not to that extreme degree . And even those who study the negative consequences of social isolation still think practicing social distancing is a good idea . " Covid-19 is flipping everything on its head , " Taylor says . " This is the first time since we have been alive that actively practicing social isolation is a method to improve health . " <p> The people who are most at risk from the isolation associated with Covid-19 are the people who are at heightened risk of social isolation in the first place . " Among older adults , lower income people and men experience isolation at a different level , " says Thomas Cudjoe , a geriatrician researching the intersection of social connections and aging at Johns Hopkins University . ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inclination to develop social ties outside of work creates the disparity between those groups and their female or higher income counterparts . ) Taylor points out that anyone who is marginalized is more likely to have a more limited social network , whether they are a member of the LGBTQ+ community , a survivor of domestic abuse , or just live in a more isolated rural area . <p> These people may not have friends or family to call , or may be unable to do so . " Some people have posited technology as a means of connecting people , but lower income groups might not even have FaceTime or Skype or minutes on their phone , " Cudjoe says . " People take that for granted , using their devices can be a strain on people 's incomes . " Particularly if Covid-19 has left them out of a job . " Minority bodies are going to be hit particularly hard because they often work in service industries , which increases risk for social isolation and loneliness and coronavirus , " says Taylor . " It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No matter what your unique situation is , there are many things you can do to improve your experience while being socially isolated . Chouker and others recommend exercise as a mood boost . " Create as much structure and predictability as you can with the pieces of your life that you do have control over , " Vincent says . Pursue neglected projects , get on with life , but also be patient with yourself -- both now and when this strange time eventually ends . People who go through a period of isolation , whether they 've been on the International Space Station or in quarantine , often experience PTSD symptoms and struggle while reintegrating back into their ordinary routine . Social isolation may gradually become your normal , and losing it may still be a jolt . <p> Fortunately , you 're not in this alone , and you should n't leave others that way , either .

@@84425441 <p> SPRINGFIELD -- As the number of cases of COVID-19 rises around the world , Baystate Health says it is well prepared and working with other Western Massachusetts health care providers to respond to the pandemic . <p> Baystate has prepared a two-bed special pathogens unit and a 12-bed isolation unit for immediate response and is working with other hospitals to ensure there is capacity to handle additional patients as cases are confirmed and require hospital treatment , said Dr. Mark A. Keroack , president and CEO of Baystate Health . <p> Keroack , who revealed there are now 24 Baystate patients suspected of having the virus , met with The Republican editorial board on Friday to outline the local response to the respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that emerged out of China at the end of December . Gov . Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on Wednesday , followed by a ban on public gatherings of more than 250 people on Friday . The governor yesterday established a special response commission . <p> While there are as of yet no confirmed or presumptive cases in Hampden County , at least 50 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2,100 confirmed cases . The worldwide total is nearing 150,000 on Saturday with more than 5,500 deaths . <p> Keroack says Baystate and the region 's other hospitals anticipate seeing a growing number of patients diagnosed with the virus in the coming weeks . <p> " It is now clear that somebody who is infected with this coronavirus can carry a large amount of this virus in their nose and mouth well before they feel very sick . Because infectious individuals are so hard to detect and because the entire population is naive , that is , not immune to this new virus we expect that we will soon be dealing with a large number of patients with either suspect or confirmed infections , " he said . " Therefore , it is important for all of us to stay informed about how we protect ourselves and to remain effective in our jobs so we can help our communities minimize the threat . " <p> In outlining the steps Baystate has taken over the past several weeks , Keroack detailed that a 12-bed isolation unit in a formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Springfield Hospital within Baystate Medical Center has been prepared for the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 . It will be used for cases that do not require intensive care but need hospital level care . <p> Baystate has also established two-bed special pathogens unit now converted to a respiratory transmission ready , intensive care unit . <p> " In addition to those 14 rooms , we have 80 other rooms with negative pressure ( to control air flow ) that can be converted to rooms where you can safely care for a coronavirus patient , " said Keroack of capacity for treatment at Baystate Medical in addition to respiratory isolation rooms available at other Baystate hospitals . <p> Coronavirus will likely be a mild illness in most people , like a cold , Keroack noted , but he added that it can cause severe complications in the elderly and frail and require hospitalization or even critical care treatment . <p> " The incident command team is considering new information on a daily basis , " he said . " This issue is very fast moving , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with issues the employees bring forward from the front lines , and we are trying to anticipate the course of the epidemic here in Western Massachusetts . " <p> The public must be an active partner in efforts to fight the spread of the virus , Keroack stressed . Following health care protocols for hygiene and social distancing are of critical importance , he said , urging the public to help hospitals respond effectively and keep their workforce healthy . <p> " We are trying to reach this balance between reassurance -- ' Everything is fine , everything is OK , ' which we ca n't say , versus the panic of run out and fill your closets with toilet paper or whatever , " Keroack said . <p> " We would like people to be concerned and basically be informed and to be prudent in terms of taking precautions to avoid exposure , but it is not like they have to lock themselves in their closets for three weeks . " <p> A shortage of test kits provided by the federal Food and Drug Administration to the state Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , Keroack said . He said Baystate is awaiting the results on about 30 test samples . <p> " This virus is here . It is in our community now -- we strongly suspect that it is -- and people need to start taking seriously all the advice on protection , " he said . <p> Good hygiene , calling one 's primary physician if experiencing related symptoms and engaging in activities that avoid close contact can all reduce the spread of the virus while allowing for some normal routine at a time when many social and other activities have been temporarily canceled , Keroack said . <p> " Hand washing , avoiding direct person contact and large crowds are at the center of how to protect yourself because we do n't yet have a vaccine or treatment for this infection , " said Keroack . " We are trying to get people to reach out by telehealth or phone first before coming in physically ( through emergency ) so that they can be screened on whether they need to come in or not . This is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our employees . " <p> He added , " The great majority of people with respiratory symptoms are OK to stay home , but a small percentage do need to come in and get seen . " <p> He said people are screened for the disease by Baystate Health , including through an app that offers access to a real-time telemedicine video visit with a Baystate primary care provider , with such questions as " Do you have a temperature over a certain amount ? " and " Are you able to speak a full sentence without losing any breaths ? " <p> Keroack 's background is in infectious disease as is that of Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein who heads Baystate 's command center for COVID-19 and who was also in attendance at the meeting with the editorial board . <p> Both stress the urgency for hospitals to have what they need to test for SARS-CoV-2 in patients their health care providers diagnosis with suspect symptoms . <p> " There has been a shortage for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to produce the test kits , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced shortages and they are having to ration them to people who are most severely ill , " said Keroack . <p> " That means when we call up to get a patient tested through the DPH we are told the patient does not fit the criteria because of the shortage . We will then send the test to a commercial lab , we use LabCorp , but the turnaround is three to four days , " he explained . " We are told it might be several weeks before we have the reagents we need at Baystate to test which would typically be a four-hour turnaround . We assay for 20 different respiratory viruses using the same equipment they do at DPH but we do n't have what we need for this virus . " <p> Artenstein said for a hospital not to be able to test within its system for the virus and get the results within hours rather than days or much longer " makes clinical decision making difficult because a lot of it is based on available information so it adds uncertainty . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Artenstein when asked whether Baystate would consider drive-through testing where a patient , with a doctor 's note and photo identification , is swabbed for a nasal specimen without having to get out of their car by health care workers in protective gear . <p> The Trump administration , in announcing Friday it would allow pharmaceutical giant Roche to sell its three-hour coronavirus test to U.S. labs , said access to such testing models as drive-through would be expanded through a Google-designed web page , but Google said it is not building such a nationwide website . <p> " We have various models ready to go , we just do n't have the kits or the availability , " said Arenstein of what it might do if it had the ability to do its own testing for SARS-CoV-2 . <p> He added the COVID-19 has " no clear cut clinical presentation that is very consistent with just one thing . " <p> " It appears with this infection the vast majority of cases are relatively mild , although we do n't know as much about it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know the denominator of patients , " Artenstein said . <p> " What we know now is the sick hospital level of patients in the United States . We may know them and test their status but they are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of level of infection in the community . " <p> Different estimates within the CDC have predicted up to half the U.S. population could eventually become infected with SARS-CoV-2 , with more than 2 million requiring hospitalization . <p> The impact of the epidemic has raised concerns around availability of hospital beds , staffing and equipment supplies , especially for those with severe complications from COVID-19 that can cause an atypical form of pneumonia and lead to organ failure . <p> " I think we are in a pretty good place locally at Baystate Health , " Arenstein said . " We feel like we are in a decent place to respond and roll with the punches for what is undoubtedly going to be a somewhat prolonged event here . This is different from a hurricane or a natural disaster where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be devastating but it is usually time limited . This could be a little bit different and we can not necessarily predict what the curve ( of impact ) will look like on this . " <p> Artenstein , too , stressed the " public has a role and responsibilities in this . " <p> " Part of the flattening of the curve , " Artenstein said , " is you still have to do the right things , and all our federal authorities -- the CDC , the National Institutes of Health , the DPH -- regionally offer good advice around the social distancing discussions they are having , the individual things you can do at little cost , a temporary inconvenience and clearly not the way we want to go about our lives as Americans , but for the short term it is the way we should in order to minimize the impact and the chance of more widespread disease . " <p> He also stressed " the majority of cases , even if they come in and get some kind of treatment and get diagnosed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue their recovery at home and be fine . " <p> He said cases with severe complications " would add a new wrinkle in terms of transmissibility " of COVID-2019 , but that Baystate is " perfectly suited to treat them as a " tertiary and quaternary care medical center that takes care of non-epidemic conditions of very , very sick patients with lots of medical needs . " <p> " We have the technical and clinical skills to do that and we do that on a daily basis with some very sick patients , " Artenstein said . <p> Keroack said he was in agreement with state health officials who did not recommend school districts issue system-wide closures in response to exposures to COVID-19 , a measure being urged by the Massachusetts Teachers Association . <p> He said he feels screening elementary students would be a better approach given what is believed to be the low transmission rate of COVID-19 among young children who generally present with no or mild symptoms of the illnesses as well as the impact on their parents , many of whom may be health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing measures , " Keroack said closing of elementary schools " is not the one I would immediately go to . " <p> " There are probably screening protocols you should be thinking of using in schools . Checking for fever , checking for symptoms , sending kids home if they are sick . " <p> Keroack said nonclinical mitigation measures taken at Baystate include limiting face-face meetings within the system to 20 people , running parking lot shuttle buses for staff more frequently to decrease the number of riders per shuttle and increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 the number of its employees working remotely at a cost of $500,000 . <p> " We know we are going to blow our budget , " said Keroack , who chairs Health New England , Baystate 's insurance arm , of the fact that the state Division of Insurance has issued an unfunded mandate that insurers cover the cost of coronavirus testing and treatment without co-pays and deductibles . <p> " Baystate as a hospital has been around for 140 years . We are here as a community resource and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces later , " Keroack said . <p> Artenstein noted , " We are in a time of impending pandemic surge , but in truth this is an annual event with most respiratory viruses . " <p> " We see a surge in influenza cases on an annual basis , " Artenstein said . <p> " But it creates less uncertainty because most people expect or know about it . People still do n't get their vaccine even though that does afford some degree of protection . " <p> Keroack noted COVID-19 's " few important differences " with influenza , also caused by RNA viruses that mute their way into humans . <p> " The first is when a new strain of flu comes in there is a lot of the population that has a little bit of immunity to it due to prior exposure to it . Cousins of that particular strain , " Keroack said . <p> " This particular virus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) has never been seen in the human population before so we are all susceptible to it and it has proven to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaky way and by the time you start seeing those severe cases that need to be in intensive care unit , there are probably dozens and dozens of cases in the community that are spreading it around . " <p> Artenstein noted that any public hoarding of supplies , such as face masks which are not recommended for the healthy to wear as a preventative measure , and hand sanitizers , creates shortages for hospitals . <p> " It is affecting all hospitals , " said Artenstein of such shortages and prices seen on some websites for items health care providers need to treat not only COVID-19 but a " range of infections as well . " <p> " Masks are scarce . Regular old masks . We have to be very careful how they are used . We want to maintain the safety of our workforce and our patients and our community . There is not a great advantage to hoarding these things outside of a health care environment simply because that is where they are really needed .

Things are moving really fast at the Capitol in terms of figuring out ways to help people , to help businesses . <p> Tell us where everything stands right now . <p> Lisa Desjardins : <p> Judy , I think , overall , think of the Capitol as a place that is trying to shore up a dam that is cracking in the middle of an earthquake . <p> They are trying to deal with now layoffs starting to come in with -- to the economy , at the same time as they know future problems are going to be worse . And they 're not sure what tools exactly can fix these problems . <p> So let 's go over exactly where we are . First of all , today , as William reported , the Senate passed the Families First Act . That goes to the president now . A reminder again , that helps deal with sick time for people who have the virus or are quarantined , and family leave for those caring for children at home , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's next is that $1 trillion stimulus plan . It could be more than a trillion dollars , Judy . And today , as Republicans gathered to try and figure out their plan , outside came a new idea from Senators Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney . They would like to focus on unemployment insurance to the tune , Judy , of perhaps 75 percent of people 's salaries , up to $80,000 . <p> That 's just one idea . But it looks like that idea of looking out for those who lose their jobs is emerging as a top factor in any of the next plans . <p> Judy Woodruff : <p> So , on the part of that that addresses small businesses , what do you see emerging there ? <p> Lisa Desjardins : <p> This seems to be the most clear consensus point in all of the parties , is that small businesses who may already be worried about going out of business this week need more help . <p> There is a plan emerging from Senators Rubio and Collins in the Republican Party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small businesses to help them continue to operate . <p> So long as those businesses use that money for payroll and operations , Judy , this plan would later forgive those loans , essentially make this a grant to perhaps thousands and thousands of small businesses around the country . The cost of that Judy , $300 billion . <p> But there is clear concern for small businesses , more than almost any other sector of the economy right now here in the U.S. Capitol . <p> Judy Woodruff : <p> So interesting . <p> All right , so I want to ask both of you , quickly , because you have both been reporting on this . And that is Bernie Sanders . Obviously , he came in behind in these latest primaries that took place yesterday . <p> Both of you have been in touch with his campaign . <p> Yamiche , what are you hearing about what his next plans are ? <p> Yamiche Alcindor : <p> Well , the Bernie Sanders campaign and the senator himself have been pushing back very hard on the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that any reports of that are false . <p> I have been talking to sources that are close to Bernie Sanders who say that he recognizes that his path is nearly impossible to winning the nomination , but that he wants to look at how he can possibly push Joe Biden further to the left and push some more progressive ideals . <p> But , today , the senator was very , very angry , in a way that I have n't seen him in the years that I have been covering him , because he even sent an expletive to a reporter who was asking him about whether or not he would be ending his campaign sometime soon . <p> Judy Woodruff : <p> And , Lisa ? <p> Lisa Desjardins : <p> Yes . <p> And , Judy , I was there , actually . That was part of a conversation I was having with Senator Sanders . I asked Senator Sanders for comments on the race . He said , no comment . <p> I moved on to ask him about the pandemic . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest he 's spoken to a reporter in a few days , about his concerns with the pandemic . That 's obviously a top priority to him . <p> Other reporters joined in , asked him again about the race , asked him repeatedly . And that was when he had that pushback . He 's turned to them and said , why are you asking me this ? We 're in the middle of a -- and then he used a strong word -- crisis . <p> Now , it seems to me that he obviously is very focused on the crisis . I asked him about the election and the crisis . And that clearly is on his mind too . He has a lot of concerns about how the election goes forward . <p> What he himself does , unclear , but he is factoring in the pandemic into all of his thoughts . That much , we can say . <p> Judy Woodruff : <p> The only thing better than having one of you reporting on Bernie Sanders is having both of you reporting on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @

This does not even take into consideration the pandemic 's psycho-social ramifications . <p> Unprecedented times such as these call for rapid decision-making , coupled with innovative and effective solutions that can address continually evolving challenges . In the past few weeks , several African countries have taken swift action to get ahead of this crisis by implementing a spectrum of measures , including closing borders , instituting curfews and lockdowns , providing public sanitation solutions , monitoring and treating cases , and providing relief measures for local businesses . It is evident that several African countries , which have been affected relatively later than some of their global counterparts , have learnt important lessons over the past few weeks and have applied these in their decision-making . <p> Yet , given the enormity and complexity of this problem , African countries should continue to observe and draw on regional , continental , and international best practices , while taking into account their respective local particularities .

Crowdfunding platforms can be a potential solution , but only if regulators are able to fast-track requisite policies and regulations to enable them to function effectively . African professionals , such as lawyers , financial advisors and consultants , can be galvanised to donate their time to support industries and sectors that have been severely affected by this pandemic and help them implement mitigating strategies . Dalberg Advisors ' Safe Hands initiative , which is taking a multi-pronged approach encompassing inputs , manufacturers , funders , distributors , and policy to support the product and distribution of essential medical supplies at scale , serves as a case in point . Corporations should also be willing to reorient their talent pool and repurpose their facilities to address the most critical issues arising from this pandemic .

Jobs need to be retained and national government must move quickly to provide relief measures for this . Countries like Kenya and Ghana have been deploying surveys to understand the difficulties businesses are facing as a result of COVID-19 , including plunging revenues , disruptions in supply chains , inability to work remotely , and having business models that are simply untenable in the context of a global pandemic . Under such circumstances , governments can -- and several have already done so -- offer stimulus packages , including tax waivers and reductions ; lower interest rates to make debt cheaper ; provide low-interest intervention loans to vulnerable companies ; defer statutory payments for a minimum of six months without penalties ; amend policies on non-performing loans to prevent a systemic crisis among banks , and provide financial support to businesses that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter is especially important for informal sector businesses that can not implement remote working measures . <p> Good governance in times of crisis requires a combination of top-down directives and bottom-up solutions . In combating this virus , one of the challenges that African governments are facing is a lack of compliance with policy directives . In some cases , the lack of compliance is not a result of disobedience , but rather structural and systemic factors unique to African countries . For instance , preventive measures , such as social distancing , are difficult to implement in informal settlements and slums where in many cases , families of six share one 20 square meter room . Also , informal sector jobs can not be performed remotely . In light of this , extreme measures are likely to cause widespread social and humanitarian problems , as seen in places like India , where a nation-wide lockdown was instituted with a mere four hours notice . In contrast , responses by several African countries , such as Angola , Senegal , Rwanda , Ghana , and Kenya , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments can offer free basic services to vulnerable communities , including providing survival packs that can cater to daily needs and working with existing organizations -- private sector and NGOs -- who have distribution networks that are able to deliver at the last mile . African governments should lobby for debt relief , and suspension of short-term payments on sovereign bonds to free up money for more urgent needs . African countries can also take advantage of regional and continental channels to collaborate with each other and exchange information on solutions that have proven/are proving to be effective . Countries that have extensive experience in battling tough epidemics , in particular , could offer valuable lessons . <p> Finally , it will not be possible to implement any solution without effective , broad-based communication . In places like the UAE , religious leaders and institutions have used their reach and influence to disseminate critical public health messaging .

@@41966241 <p> Gemma Peters , chief executive of Blood Cancer UK , is worried . The coronavirus lockdown has had a drastic effect on cancer care . Data now emerging suggests that , within the past two months , two-week urgent referrals for cancer tests and diagnoses have fallen by an average of 76 per cent in some places . It 's a " horrendous " situation , says Peters . <p> Delays can be particularly deadly for certain cancer patients , she explains . For instance , people with blood cancer can find that it takes a relatively long time before they receive a diagnosis -- often because symptoms of the disease are difficult to distinguish from other conditions . " We 're going to have a whole load of people with blood cancers being diagnosed later , " says Peters . That means worse outcomes for patients , more pressure on the healthcare system and the worrying possibility that those patients , who might be identified when their cancer has progressed to a more severe stage , will not be well enough to take part in clinical trials of drugs that could help them . <h> Advertisement <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another problem : reduced funding for cancer charities .

In terms of treatment , hospitals are setting up hubs designed to be free of Covid-19 . Cancer patients can visit such facilities in order to have surgery , for example . However , Cancer Research UK has said that , to date , the provision of these hubs in Wales has been slow , whereas 21 centres have been established in England . <p> Problems do n't just lie in the availability of services .

Late diagnoses could mean cancers that are more difficult to treat and patients who suffer from worse symptoms , the statement adds.The UKONS says that patients with weight loss , unexplained bleeding , new lumps or any other potential cancer symptoms should report them to their GP . <h> Read next <h> Boris Johnson is about to face his coronavirus trolley problem <p> ByGian Volpicelli <p> A group of researchers in the UK recently published a preprint paper detailing the drop-off in urgent cancer referrals , based on information from two London hospitals , one hospital in Leeds and all the Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland . The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might arise during the pandemic . <h> Advertisement <p> Chemotherapy attendances were down 60 per cent on average and urgent referrals were down 76 per cent on average , the researchers found . There has been much discussion about the extent to which urgent referrals have fallen across the country . On May 1 , the Health and Social Care Committee heard from Cally Palmer , the National Cancer Director , that the reduction in appointments was 62 per cent . <p> " We absolutely have evidence that the number of urgent referrals for early diagnosis ... has plummeted , " says Harry Hemingway at UCL 's Institute of Health Informatics , one of the preprint 's co-authors . However , Hemingway argues that not enough data is available to give a full picture of what 's happening to cancer healthcare across the NHS . Information from the national cancer registry or real-time , UK-wide data on hospital admissions , for example , would help fill in the gaps , he says . <p> The study he and his colleagues made relied instead on records supplied by the aforementioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to share their data so quickly was a " remarkable achievement " , says Hemingway . <p> His team also used a model to estimate that there will be a total of 17,915 excess deaths in England among new and existing cancer patients after one year . That includes deaths caused by either cancer , Covid-19 or other health issues -- there is n't sufficient data to be more specific , says Hemingway . Plus , the model does not reveal the number of deaths that could be caused because of missed or late cancer diagnoses during the lockdown -- again , Prof Hemingway says he and his team would require more data to model that . But the analysis remains an indication of how perilous the current situation is for cancer patients . <h> Read next <h> How coronavirus started and what happens next , explained <p> ByMatt Reynolds and Sabrina Weiss <p> Other estimates paint an even starker picture . Karol Sikora is chief medical officer of Rutherford Cancer Centres , a network of cancer clinics in the UK . He says his " back-of-the-envelope " calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change in the uptake of referrals for diagnosis and treatment for a total of six months . The figure is based on the fact that 180,000 treatable cancer patients are identified every year in the UK but a third of them could pass away if everyone 's treatment is delayed by six months . That would mean 60,000 deaths , says Sikora . <p> It should be noted that while chemotherapy and operations remain cancelled for many , some hospitals are now starting to offer such treatments again . Some have questioned whether the government could have begun relaxing the lockdown sooner in order to avoid such a catastrophe . On April 8 , Sikora said on Twitter that he thought the UK had reached the peak of infections and that the country would be able to begin easing the lockdown by April 27 . However , the numbers of Covid-19 cases reported each day remained flat for the following fortnight . <p> " It has been slower than I thought , " he now says . In a recent article published on ITV 's website , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictive measures that it had . <p> The frontline of the cancer diagnostic system is GPs surgeries . It is there that patients may first raise their symptoms with a health professional who can then refer them on for scans or tests that can show whether they have cancer . And GPs surgeries are where the public 's current reluctance to engage with the healthcare system is being noticed . <p> Neil Bhatia is a GP in Hampshire . He says that many patients are continuing to stay in touch via an online system called eConsult . It allows patients to send in queries about their health -- and even attach photos of visible symptoms . Bhatia and his colleagues spend their days working through submissions filed online in this way and responding to patients , for example , via telephone appointments . While there is still plenty of work to do , Dr Bhatia says he is aware that people 's willingness to contact their doctor has changed . " I do think patients are thinking twice , " he says . " They have the misconception that unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHS at all . " <h> Read next <h> ' I 'm furious ' : Failing care homes are the real coronavirus scandal <p> BySabrina Weiss <p> The idea that patients are not disclosing important symptoms is alarming many GPs .

" GP referrals " save lives " he notes , adding , " We ca n't stress enough how important it is that patients with any concerns about their health , not just potential cancer symptoms , seek the appropriate medical attention . " <p> Bhatia agrees , and points out that there is a wide range of diseases beyond cancer to think about . For instance , patients might think that their persistent cough is a coronavirus symptom and simply follow the official advice on how to manage Covid-19 . However , a chronic cough could indicate something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters also notes that some symptoms of blood cancer including fatigue , fever and breathing difficulties , could also be mistaken for Covid-19 . <p> Then there are other signs and symptoms that patients might think they can put up with for a while but which really should be urgently addressed . " It could be something like rheumatoid arthritis , " says Bhatia . " The longer you leave the arthritis active , the more joint destruction happens . ... They 're the sort of person you would want to refer to a specialist soon . " <p> Delaying treatment can have potentially disastrous consequences . Anna , not her real name , is convinced that her father 's heart attack could have been avoided if it had n't been for social distancing and the pressure on health services . <p> She says her father , a throat cancer survivor , had been experiencing discomfort in his chest for around two weeks before the heart attack occurred . Since the incident , he has commented that he considered mentioning the pain at his wife 's cardiology appointment -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that the lockdown was ultimately a necessary measure , adds that in normal circumstances her father might have mentioned his symptoms in passing to a family member .

Whether it 's GPs seeing fewer patients with cancer symptoms , or families divided , a breakdown in communication is a threat to public health , says Bhatia . <p> " The intention was never to not communicate with each other -- it was just not to communicate face to face , " he says .

@@41935741 <h> George Cooper <h> April 24th , 2020 <h> Chinese state censorship of COVID-19 research represents a looming crisis for academic publishers <p> Issues of censorship surrounding the publication of scholarly research in China have been prominent since a series of press reports and publisher statements revealed that works had been removed from circulation that were deemed sensitive by Chinese buyers . As George Cooper observes , evidence that Chinese authorities are conducting pre-publication vetting of COVID-19 related research , raises new challenges for publishers seeking to distribute open access research papers on this subject , as there is little ground for publishers to remove these papers from their platforms . As publisher commitments to openness collide with their obligations to operate within the legal frameworks of the countries they operate in , it is argued that COVID-19 presages an overdue discussion on the limits of openness in publishing . <p> Earlier this month , the websites of Fudan University and the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan briefly revealed a system of pre-publication vetting of COVID-19 research . If accurate , these regulations could have far-reaching consequences , both for research communities in China , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , revealed requirements for China-based researchers to seek approval from China 's Ministry of Science and Technology before publishing research on the novel coronavirus , with a special emphasis on articles that pinpoint its origins . Publications will be vetted by government officials , who will assess both their ' academic value ' and whether the ' timing for publishing is right , ' raising the spectre of scholarly censorship that routinely shrouds research activities in China . <p> For now , China 's restrictions on COVID-19 research apply only to domestic scholarship . But research in China on COVID-19 is published widely , often in high-impact , English-language journals . Given recent precedents , pre-publication restrictions could signal a shift in focus regarding the post-publication distribution of journal articles by non-Chinese scholarly publishers . In recent years , journal articles on topics such as persecution of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang , civil unrest in Hong Kong , and the ' three Ts ' -- Tiananmen , Tibet and Taiwan -- have come under intense scrutiny by Chinese state authorities . Cambridge University Press , Springer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2018 , were forced to navigate the demands of the General Administration of Press and Publications , rendering the distribution of research containing sensitive keywords , such as ' Xinjiang ' and ' Cultural Revolution ' , illegal in China . These events led to accusations of censorship complicity , as some publishers took steps to remove or restrict access to sensitive articles on their Chinese-language platforms ; whilst others had entire journals removed from circulation by Chinese research importers for refusing to ' bowdlerize ' their online collections . <p> As has been reported elsewhere , China 's state censors have already used keyword-based targeting to remove posts related to COVID-19 on WeChat , and other social media platforms , including the combinations ' unknown Wuhan pneumonia ' , ' Wuhan seafood market ' and ' Sars variation . ' If similar methods are used to target ' illegal ' COVID-19 research , they will extend beyond the typical targets of state censorship . All the main research publishers are fast-tracking COVID-19 research for publication and distribution on a free-access basis . Unlike previous red-flag topics , concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing body of COVID-19 research cuts across disciplines in the behavioural and medical sciences . Few scientific outputs focus solely on ' non-sensitive ' aspects of the pandemic , as illustrated by recent medical studies that necessarily pinpoint the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan to give a full picture of its epidemiology . <p> These consequences should be explored and planned for now , before they become a stark reality . Restrictions on the publication and dissemination of research on the COVID-19 outbreak would risk significant financial penalties for publishers that resist , and severe reputational penalties for those that do n't <p> Whilst COVID-19 research circulates freely , seemingly without restriction , this is not solely due to publishers ' philanthropic efforts to serve scholarly communities tackling the global pandemic . Most COVID-19 research outputs are published fully Open Access under Creative Commons licenses . As a document search in Scopus shows , of the 1,799 documents indexed ( to-date ) that feature the term ' COVID-19 ' in their title , abstract and/or text , 1,454 are Open Access . A significant subset of this research has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic and Social Research Council , the European Commission , and the US 's National Science Foundation , that have mandated full , unrestricted , global access to the published version of record . Of the authors listed against these articles , the largest number ( 577 ) are affiliated with Chinese research institutions , followed by the US ( 379 ) and the UK ( 223 ) . Approximately 30% of authors would have been subject to the new pre-publication checks in China , had they published their research after the new regulations came into force . <p> The censorship demands that publishers faced in 2017 and 2018 concerned scholarship in the social sciences , in paywalled , subscription-access form . Many of the implicated publishers argued , rightly , that they were forced to find routes to comply with China 's censorship demands , as they have no influence over the legal frameworks regarding the sale of publications , or over the purchasing decisions of Chinese research importers . It remains to be seen whether Open Access articles will escape these restrictions , as they 're disseminated freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting the sale of publications . But equally , state authorities such as the General Administration of Press and Publications could threaten publishers , as they have before , with a ban on the import of their entire output in China , unless suitable amendments are made to their Chinese-language platforms . An unexplored consequence of forcing publishers to comply with censorship demands in the case of Open Access research is that the less censorious route -- refusing to make amendments to the content of journals , prompting importers to remove journals from circulation instead -- would not be available . Publishers would be confronted with a binary choice : remove ' sensitive ' Open Access articles from their Chinese platforms , or risk huge losses of revenues and access for their entire published output . <p> If full , unrestricted , global Open Access is not possible , full disclosure and transparency , where obstacles exist , allows for a better-informed debate on the limits of ' openness ' , which ought to continue beyond the current crisis <p> These consequences should be explored and planned for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication and dissemination of research on the COVID-19 outbreak would risk significant financial penalties for publishers that resist , and severe reputational penalties for those that do n't . They would represent an apparent conflict between the academic interests of ' openness ' and transparency that publishers aspire towards ( and are in some cases mandated to fulfil ) , whilst operating in increasingly ' closed ' legal frameworks regarding research dissemination . If publishers are again faced with the 99% vs. 1% dilemma by government agencies in China , a response should be coordinated across the industry , via trade bodies such as the STM Association , the Association of University Presses , the International Publishers ' Association , and the Committee on Publication Ethics . <p> The difficulties inherent in balancing principles of Open Access with the reality of China 's legal framework are shared across the scholarly communications industry . As is a shared commitment to the rapid , open dissemination of peer-reviewed research on COVID-19 . These shared challenges and objectives could be an organising principle for a set of industry standards regarding research censorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent -- as is already the case for retractions , errata and corrigenda . If full , unrestricted , global Open Access is not possible , full disclosure and transparency , where obstacles exist , allows for a better-informed debate on the limits of ' openness ' , which ought to continue beyond the current crisis .

A football and a garden at home in Skibbereen helped lay the foundations for what 's been a meteoric rise through the club , divisional and inter-county ranks . <p> But what makes O'Mahony 's ascension even more remarkable is the fact she did n't start training or playing football competitively until 2010 . <p> ' Gymnastics was the main sport I was interested in when I was younger , ' O'Mahony told The Southern Star . <p> ' I never had a huge love for any of the sports I was involved in and quit most of them back then .

Some of the Cork girls are shocked when I tell them I only began playing football properly about ten years ago . ' <p> Three epic U12 county championship encounters with Carrigaline brought O'Mahony and O'Donovan Rossa on leaps and bounds .

At a young age , we would have been watching Cork win all their All-Irelands and kind of expected that we were going to win ourselves at some stage . That was n't the case though . <p> ' Likewise , losing last year 's All-Ireland semi-final to Dublin just shows you all the hard work you put in , sometimes , does not mean you are going to win . You just have to come back stronger and work harder than ever . ' <p> Every child needs a hero to look up to .

O'Mahony had moved to the city and established herself as one of the Cork seniors ' most consistent performers during the league campaign despite being deployed in an unfamiliar half-back role . <p> But the Covid-19 outbreak altered everything . Adhering to HSE guidelines , O'Mahony is currently back at home in Skibb along with her mother Deirdre , father James and older sister Grace . <p> ' I remember being in UCC 's Western Gateway campus building when Leo Varadkar 's speech came on television , ' O'Mahony commented . <p> ' Everyone watching realised the seriousness of what was happening .

She grabbed her opportunity . <p> ' Growing up , I was never the one relied on to get all the scores for my club or West Cork even though I mostly played half-forward or midfield , ' O'Mahony noted . <p> ' I was often complimented on my tackling ability over the years but never paid much attention to it .

I do n't think I did too bad and it gave me the confidence that I could play in that position . ' <p> Despite Covid-19 , the signs in the opening rounds of the league were that O'Mahony is ready to make her mark at county level . <p> In 2017 she made history as the first player from O'Donovan Rossa Ladies GAA Club to win an All-Ireland medal following her success with the Cork minors and now she 's close to earning her spot in the senior team .

Now anxiety has become the new normal . <p> The country is already transformed .

This can be weekly video calls with the extended family or book club chats even if no one has read the book -- to drink wine and talk . Self-care has to be about more than just rest and relaxation ; right now , it 's about showing up for the people around us . That is the most powerful reminder we have that we 're not alone , that we have a responsibility to our families and our wider communities . <p> While our physical world is being restructured , our emotional world is reeling .

@@41931341 <h> Adversity is the best teacher <p> Shiv Shankar Menon , Indian diplomat and former National Security Adviser , has said of the post Covid-19 situation : " We are headed for a poorer , meaner , and smaller world . " The world no doubt is being pushed back by this unprecedented pandemic , but the question is , what is the way to a better future ? The only thing that will help secure a better future is education . As Nelson Mandela said , " Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world . " At the moment education is in doldrums . The gates of schools and college are locked . The problems that students face are of three dimensions : The first is psychological . Students are traumatised by the situation of lockdown after lockdown . They also fear for their lives and of their loved ones from the coronavirus . There is yet another element to it : domestic abuse and violence . Gender-based violence , described by the UN as a " shadow pandemic " , has significantly increased during the lockdown . Brown , Brett V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence in the lives of children " , that children who are exposed to violence at home may have difficulty in learning and limited social skills . They may also exhibit violent , risky or delinquent behaviour , or suffer from depression or severe anxiety . The second is sociological . Students , especially teenagers , ca n't stay focused unless they are connected to their peer group . They excel and are motivated when they are connected to a larger group . The lockdown and frequent snapping of communication has made them lonelier and less motivated . The third is methodological . Technology is being seen as a solution to the current shutdown of academic institutions . Certain private and government schools have already gone online . But there are problems . As per the India Internet 2019 report , there is only 36% IPR ( internet penetration rate ) in India . The IPR is determined by the number of individuals aged above 12 years per 100 population who accessed the internet in the last month . Also , the gender divide is significant with respect to internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to internet . Then there is the disparity among states , e.g. , Delhi NCR has IPR of 69% , followed by Kerala at 54% , but states likes Odisha ( 25% ) , Jharkhand ( 26% ) and Bihar ( 28% ) are at the bottom . Keeping such problems in view , a pragmatic strategy can be drawn . Students should firstly be encouraged to not get bogged down in apprehensions or anxiety but instead look forward to the future . There is no ignoring the fact that the resources are limited as of now , but those who excel are the ones who make the most of the resources available . In 1665 , the University of Cambridge was temporarily closed due to the Bubonic plague . Isaac Newton had to work from home , and he used this time to develop the calculus and the theory of gravity .

We can not deny that it is an uphill struggle to learn or study when the atmosphere is filled with fear , depression and anxiety . The facts and daily figures of the pandemic have created a sense of further desperation and hopelessness . The coronavirus is not only hitting our mental well-being but our economy as well . It will transform our lives in many ways . We will be more dependent on technology . Our way of schooling may change , at least for a few years . But this Covid-19 pandemic , too , shall pass .

@@31784541 <h> It 's time for the NHL to cancel the rest of the regular season <p> NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman continues to hold out hope that the league will be able to finish its regular season . John Minchillo/Associated Press <p> The NHL , still clinging to its hopes of finishing the season -- and still clinging to fans ' ticket money as long as it classifies games as postponed instead of canceled -- has prolonged its self-quarantine recommendation through April 30 . That means hockey wo n't return before mid-May if at all , perilously near the point when it would be wise to lock up the Zamboni until next season . <p> Maybe that time already has arrived . But there 's one reasonable option left before the ice is melted : Ditch the rest of the regular season . <p> Cancel the remaining games , about 15 percent of the schedule , so ticket-holding fans can get their money back to buy necessities . Cancel those games so teams that were eliminated do n't have to go through a farce of a training camp to play a dozen games just so Commissioner Gary Bettman can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play-in tournament for teams that were n't in playoff spots because it would devalue regular-season games that were played . Go right to the Stanley Cup playoffs if you must go at all , with qualifiers based on point percentage because teams had played a varying number of games when Bettman halted play March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> The latest extension of the league 's stay-at-home recommendation , announced Tuesday , was the third delay . In a one-paragraph statement , the league said that after consulting with medical experts and representatives of the NHL Players ' Association , it had " made the decision to extend the self-quarantine recommendation for NHL players , coaches and hockey staff through and including Thursday , April 30 . The self-quarantine had been in place through April 15 . " <p> The decision was n't a surprise , and it was n't definitive . It could n't be .

That reopening , presumably , will be led by those leagues . " We have to get our sports back . I 'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old , " Trump said at his daily news briefing . <p> In the case of the NHL , which stands to miss out on about $1 billion in revenues if it ca n't resume , teams were asked to provide potential home dates into August .

Eliminate bye weeks and gaps in the schedule , and a " normal " cycle could resume . <p> Speaking on Monday to CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Bettman acknowledged players would need two or three weeks of training camp before competition resumes .

" The fact is , when you 're in the position that all of us are in , you have to be prepared to relaunch when the opportunity presents itself , which means you have to not rule out any conceivable alternative and be prepared on every one even if some of them ultimately turn out not to be realistic , " he said . <p> Grand Forks is unrealistic as a site for 16 teams in first-round play .

This $349 billion " loan " program provides financial assistance to small businesses ( up to 500 employees ) under financial stress because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown measures needed to fight the spread of the virus . An overview of the program is available in a summary from the US Treasury . <p> Offering funds covering up to eight weeks of payroll , the program 's purpose is to reduce the growth of unemployment , help small businesses retain employees , and enable them to rebound quickly after the pandemic is under control . The kicker is that the funds are , in the words of the US Treasury , " forgivable loans . " If your small business meets certain conditions , it will not have to repay the money . <p> The word on the street among small businesses is that these are basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a small business " you 'd have to be crazy not to apply . " However , before you apply , beware the legal risks . There are potential pitfalls in what you need to certify to receive a " loan " under the program . <p> In its website section on the program , under Loan Details and Forgiveness , the US Small Business Administration ( SBA ) states : " The loan will be fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs , interest on mortgages , rent , and utilities ( due to likely high subscription , at least 75% of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll ) . Loan payments will also be deferred for six months . No collateral or personal guarantees are required . Neither the government nor lenders will charge small businesses any fees . Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels . Forgiveness will be reduced if full-time headcount declines , or if salaries and wages decrease . " <p> There is little legislative history on the CARES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a podcast interview with Florida Senator Marco Rubio , the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship ( which developed the law ) . Rubio makes it clear that the government wants small businesses to apply and that they do not need to repay the loan in most situations . In fact , he sometimes calls it a " grant . " <p> I 've come across many credible non-government resources with details on the program , which could provide your business with a grant equal to 250% of your total average monthly payroll in the prior year ( up to $10 million ) . Sound commentaries on the program include blogs from Accounting Prose , The Wordstream Blog , small-business expert Barry Moltz , The Finance Buff , and Forbes.com blogger Kelly Phillips Erb , so look at those if you need more background . <p> The Certification In The Loan Application That Raises Questions <p> The loan application , while relatively easy to complete , does require you to initial certain certifications . For businesses that are still operating , the conditions to certify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant . This certification and the others directly reflect provisions in the CARES Act ( see Section 1102 at the top of page 11 ) . <p> Frankly , I do n't know any small business that does not face significant uncertainty right now . Some are completely closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic . Others remain open with a reduced staff . In the months ahead , even businesses that manage to break even could lose contracts and deplete emergency funds . However , it seems obvious that the certification wording applies particularly to certain businesses directly impacted by the pandemic shutdown measures : for example , the struggling restaurants and many retail stores around my office ; on a personal level , the bowling alley my mother owns , my brother-in-law 's residential real estate agency , and my friend 's vacation travel consulting business . <p> For many small businesses that are not directly or indirectly forced to close , including my own ( largely focused on employee stock plan educational resources through the website myStockOptions.com ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard required for a forgivable loan by the PPP .

Could the lure of " free money " for small businesses that do n't fully meet the PPP standards backfire and get them in trouble later ? <p> Major Law Firms Point Out Legal Risks <p> In a business-law alert , the law firm Quarles &amp; Brady explains the following ( in this and the followed quotations I have bolded part of the text for emphasis ) . " The PPP application requires the applicant to make a number of certifications , including : ' Current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant . ' The SBA has not provided any definition or color about the nature or extent of the required impact to operations that would make the loan request ' necessary to support ongoing operations , ' which has both applicants and lenders skittish about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar client alert , the law firm Venable points out : " Borrowers must certify on the application that ' current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant . ' There is little guidance as to what exactly this means . " <p> In its commentary on the program , the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray goes so far as to warn about possible legal exposure under the False Claims Act ( FCA ) : " Already , news and opinion articles are addressing ( and Members of Congress are saying ) that there will be significant oversight over funds distributed through PPP . Private individuals have also made clear that they intend to exercise their rights under the Freedom of Information Act to identify the recipients of PPP loans with a view to identifying those who , in their view , were not the intended beneficiaries of the program . Applicants should be aware of possible negative public relations consequences of participating in the program ( even if clearly eligible ) , and that clients who take aggressive positions with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In an article on the False Claims Act , Ropes &amp; Gray cautions that a misrepresentation included in an application for small business funding under the CARES Act may result in FCA liability . The firm advises applicants to take care to " avoid intentionally or recklessly running afoul of the eligibility criteria . " It concludes with a warning : " In sum , while the CARES Act provides important and valuable benefits to small businesses and the economy at large , businesses and their affiliates must pay increased attention to the CARES Act programs ' eligibility and certification requirements to avoid potential exposure to FCA liability , particularly in light of the rapidly evolving landscape . " <p> The SBA or US Treasury Department needs to provide more guidance , with an objective measure , on the conditions needed to meet this certification and others in the loan application . One idea for the Treasury is to wield the revenue-decline standard that appears in the CARES Act ( see Section 2301 pages 67 -- 68 ) . This allows certain employers affected by COVID-19 to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified wages ( including health benefits ) up to $10,000 per employee for wages paid after March 12 , 2020 , and before January 1 , 2021 . <p> Your business is eligible for this credit only if ( 1 ) the operation of that business is fully or partially suspended by the government due to COVID-19 , or ( 2 ) the business 's gross revenue is less than 50% of what it was the prior year 's calendar quarter , in which case the credit is available until the business recovers to earn at least 80% of the prior year 's revenue . It 's important to note that businesses which receive a loan under the new Paycheck Protection Program are not eligible for this payroll tax credit . <p> Update ( Apr. 15 , 2020 ) : The US Treasury and the US Small Business Administration ( SBA ) have published FAQs on the Paycheck Protection Program .

" <h> So which country has the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they began testing very quickly and extensively , so we like Iceland because they have been very effective , " said Professor O'Neill . <p> " Germany has done a fantastic job as well , they got in very early with testing , those are the two countries that really stand out at doing a great job . ( ... ) <p> " But , in truth , it 's a mixed picture , some countries are n't doing enough and there have been problems with getting enough test kits in ( ... ) so it has been a challenge for some countries . " <h> Can people be infected more than once ? <p> " The answer is we do n't fully know but there is good evidence that you 're probably protected if you 've been infected , " said Professor O'Neill . <p> " For example , there was an experiment done with monkeys which they infected with the virus and then tried to re-infect them and they could n't . Secondly , we know we make a big antibody response to this virus , loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real virus-busters by the way and if you carry those antibodies then it means you had the virus and are no longer infectious . <p> " There is good evidence that you should be protected , the question is how long will that protection last and people who work on other coronaviruses say about a year maybe which is good . " <h> What 's the best medication to fight COVID-19 ? What about hydroxychloroquine ? <p> " Hydroxychloroquine is interesting because it has shown to have effects against the virus ( ... ) but we 've got to be very , very careful though because there is no doubt it damages the heart in a small number of patients , " said Professor O'Neill . <p> " The problem is COVID-19 is heart-damaging as well . So the worry we have there is this is a double-whammy if you give this medication to someone and they 've already got heart problems , there is a risk it might make it worse . The trials are progressing very , very carefully and there is still no compelling evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials and then we 'll know . I would urge caution with this drug until those trials are done . ( ... ) In the next three or four weeks , that 's the key window now , for some of these medicines the results will begin to emerge and we 're all keeping our fingers firmly crossed . " <p> " There are concerns about safety on a couple of levels , some patients have very toxic reactions to hydroxychloroquine or other drugs so we have to be quite cautious , " Dr Moon said . <p> " It 's normal that there is a lot of panic during a pandemic with a new virus . Doctors and nurses are faced with very difficult decisions every day . So it 's understandable that we 're throwing the medicine chest at patients in some ways but we really have to be very cautious and let the trials answer the questions in a definitive way . " <h> How do we make sure people have access to the drugs once an effective one is found ? <p> " We 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions and countries that have the capacity to manufacture the medicines will most likely make sure their own people are served first , " said Dr Moon . <p> " We have a huge concentration globally in the way that medicines are manufactured , only a handful of countries have large-scale manufacturing . So the question of how we make sure that effective drugs reach everybody who needs them in all countries without bankrupting health systems is a huge issue , we have not made enough progress in addressing it . " <h> What about a vaccine , when is that going to happen ? <p> " It 's not realistic to say we are going to have any vaccine approved until next year , " said Dr Moon . " People estimate at least 12 to 18 months to have regulatory approval of that vaccine which is not the same thing as saying it 's been manufactured and is available around the world . <p> " This is really unprecedented , I have to emphasise that we have never before had a pandemic that has spread so quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vaccines at the same time . <p> " I am more worried about medicines because we are going to see the results of the trials are going to come out in the next few weeks and the scramble for drugs is going to be instant . We do n't have the measures in place either to ramp up production , get over export bans or make sure that some of the developing and poor countries have the money to compete as buyers with some of the richer countries . We are going to see countries really being left behind in the scramble for drugs . " <h> This disease does not just cause respiratory symptoms , what are the other effects possible ? <p> " It 's a nasty virus , " said Professor O'Neill . " The receptor for the virus called ACE 2 , that 's the thing the virus locks on to with its spikes , to get inside cells , that is in your lungs , in your gut , it 's in your heart and it may even be in your brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die of respiratory failure . The others are more symptomatic , although there may be a cause of death in these tissues as well , but , the main cause of death is the lung problem . " <h> What should I take if I have mild symptoms ? <p> " There is no cure , there is nothing obvious , " said Professor O'Neill . " You take paracetamol for your temperature because fever is a key feature . Paracetamol is a very safe drug that works very well to bring down the fever and it can help with some of the aches and pains , the typical flu-like symptoms . Stay very well hydrated , drink lots of water . Your immune system uses a lot of water to keep it going . And you have to look after your immune system , That means trying to get a good night 's sleep , try and exercise and have a good diet and try and de-stress because that really damages our immune response . " <h> What is the deal with masks ? Does it protect you against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing masks is to protect everybody else , " said Dr Moon . " If you are sick and of course many of us do n't know if we 're carrying the coronavirus , but whatever the case , if you 're wearing a mask you will minimise the amount of virus you are putting into the atmosphere . <p> " There is a hypothesis that Asian countries where it is more customary to wear a mask , the fact that many are wearing masks has helped get this epidemic under control . <p> " But a lot of countries are really experimenting while watching others very closely to see what seems to be making a difference and what does n't . <p> " There is a major concern that if many people go out to buy masks , there will be a shortage in hospitals and there is another concern that if you do n't know how to use a mask and you touch it and touch your face , you may increase the risk . So it 's not a black and white issue and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend to our people . "	
@@61818441 <h> How the lockdown alcohol ban has improved road safety <p> The ban on alcohol sales has had an undeniable positive effect on road safety , and many are calling for more stringent regulation when the lockdown ends . Image : Marian Vejcik / 123rf <p> For some South Africans , one of the contentious regulations during lockdown has been the ban on alcohol sales . Following the extension of the lockdown , many were hoping this ban would be relaxed but they were disappointed on April 16 when this was firmly denied . <p> The managing director of MasterDrive , Eugene Herbert , said one area where the ban on alcohol can have a drastic impact is in the cost of alcohol-related accidents on the gross domestic product ( GDP ) . <p> " Research from the government and public-health sector says the annual tangible and intangible cost to the country of alcohol-related harm is between 10% and 12% of the country 's GDP . <p> " What percentage of this can be specifically attributed to car crashes is not stated . It is interesting to note is that in the Easter road crash and fatality statistics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher police presence , compared to last year 's 800 arrests . It is clear changing drinking behaviour can considerably affect the high road accident rates in the country .

Instead , we can use the data the lockdown gives us to illustrate just how detrimental drinking and driving can be . The true implications of alcohol consumption and driving compared to a period with very limited drinking and driving can not be denied , " said Herbert . <p> These area few examples of how the ban on alcohol has had positive effects : <p> Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town has reduced the caseload at their trauma centre by two thirds now that there are fewer drinking and driving accidents . <p> After the first week of lockdown , doctors in Johannesburg reported little to no car crashes involving alcohol . <p> An alcohol and drug abuse researcher at the SA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model showing a 25% reduction in trauma cases related to drinking ( including injury from crimes as well as car accidents ) . <p> A public health-care doctor said the situation Italian doctors faced when they decided who to save and who would die is a scenario faced in South Africa every day , and he attributed alcohol consumption in incidents of violence and in car accidents as the main reason for this . <p> The reduction in trauma cases across the country is propelling health-care workers , politicians , researchers and others to push to keep the ban in place while we battle Covid-19 , and for more drastic regulation after that . <p> Herbert said : " The difficulty , however , is that someone who gets behind the wheel with a blood alcohol content level of 0,05mg/100ml is just as likely to disobey a zero-alcohol limit . <p> " This is why gathering data and evidence of the impact that drinking and driving has on the country during a time when it was drastically reduced is so important .

If you may have been one of the people who would get behind the wheel after drinking , it is time to change .

Photo : Taiwan Presidential Office-AFP-Handout ) <p> While WHO is the wing of the UNO , there is subtle difference between the functioning style of WHO and expectations from it . <p> UNO is essentially a politically tinted organization with membership for some countries being denied in UNO due to political reasons .

@@41925241 <h> Pneumonia is a complication of many respiratory infections , including Covid-19 <p> If your baby is unusually fussy and does n't feed well , it might be a sign that they have pneumonia , even if they do n't have a fever . -- Filepic <p> One of the main worries when a child catches an infection of the respiratory system , is that it will develop into pneumonia , which can be fatal . <p> In fact , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that the annual death rate of children below the age of five years worldwide due to pneumonia is 18% . That is 1.4 million children every year . <p> According to consultant paediatric respiratory physician Dr Norzila Mohamed Zainudin , pneumonia is an infection of the lungs involving the alveoli , or air sacs , where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged . <p> It occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria , viruses and fungi , invade the lungs and infect the alveoli . <p> Consequently , they become filled with fluid and pus , causing coughs , unrelenting fevers , difficulty breathing and chills . <p> " As you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper respiratory tract . <p> " With the common cold , there is a runny nose , a little bit of a fever and sneezing . <p> " It is normally not serious , and while it can not be treated with medicine , it usually goes away by itself within a couple of days , " she explains . <p> She adds : " However , the cold is not to be mistaken with influenza , which refers to a specific strain of viruses . " <p> While the symptoms of influenza may be similar to the common cold initially , what distinguishes the two is that influenza can lead to very serious health complications . <p> In children , this might manifest in the form of bluish lips or a temperature above 40 ? C. <p> The symptoms , including fatigue , chills and severe aches , often occur abruptly when compared to the common cold , and may develop into pneumonia . <p> " Usually , they can present with just inactivity and might not even have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may have vomiting , or even diarrhoea . <p> " By the time the parents realise that the child is unwell , they could already be very , very sick with either rapid or irregular breathing . " <p> Bear in mind that it is important that you bring your child to see their doctor if they fall sick . <p> Pneumonia symptoms may look like other health problems , so parents should always seek a proper medical diagnosis for their children . <p> " You ca n't go to the pharmacy and say ' My child has pneumonia ' and ask for medicines . <p> " You would n't know . You still need to go to the doctor to make a clinical diagnosis . <p> " The doctor will make the decision on whether the treatment will be done at home , at the hospital or in an intensive care unit ( ICU ) , " she says . <p> Test and treat <p> A course of antibiotics is a common treatment for mild cases of pneumonia . -- TNS <p> A variety of tests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child has pneumonia . <p> The first step is the physical examination where the doctor may hear abnormal sounds in the lungs using the stethoscope . <p> This finding will prompt further testing to determine the root cause of the abnormal sounds . <p> Both chest X-rays and blood tests can be done to check for signs of infection . <p> Another option is a nasal swab to check for common infectious microorganisms . <p> Once a diagnosis of pneumonia is made , the decision on what treatment to give will depend on how severe the pneumonia is . <p> Treatment is usually supportive , e.g. bed rest and lots of fluids , as pneumonia is often viral , which has no cure . <p> Mild symptoms of pneumonia are commonly treated with at least a short course of antibiotics lasting three to five days at home , before the patient is seen again for reevaluation . <p> " However , if a child is displaying moderate or severe symptoms , they will need to be admitted . <p> " They will likely need intravenous ( IV ) antibiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . <p> " Usually , for a majority of children with pneumonia , if given the right treatment , it will get resolved with no residual effects on them , " says Dr Norzila . <p> Risk of infection <p> Among the risk factors for developing pneumonia is age . The two most vulnerable groups to pneumonia are children under the age of two years and adults aged 65 and above . <p> " For the younger children , it 's because their immunity is still developing , " Dr Norzila explains . <p> " Then , you also have children who are not immunised . They are at a greater risk of contracting pneumonia . " <p> These children include those who are born with an immunodeficiency and have low immunity , child cancer patients and those on immunosuppressant medication , e.g. children who have received an organ transplant . <p> A lot of risk factors are external . <p> Exposure to a dirty , unhygienic environment or large crowds of people increases the possibility of being exposed to infectious microorganisms . <p> The lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered immunity to infections . <p> " Taking the pneumococcal vaccine , Haemophilus influenzae type B ( Hib ) vaccine and other flu vaccines available reduces the risk of pneumonia in vulnerable groups , especially the young children .

Says Dr Norzila : " The other thing that I 'm always concerned about is recurrent pneumonia . <p> " There are children who get pneumonia once or twice , but there are some children who keep coming to the hospital with recurrent pneumonia . " <p> As the name implies , recurrent pneumonia is defined as three or more episodes of pneumonia in a lifetime , or two or more episodes within a six-month period . <p> It is a condition that should be investigated with urgency to determine the underlying causes . <p> Recurrent pneumonia occurs mainly for three reasons : <p> Structural issues between the bronchus , the breathing tube of the body , and the oesophagus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immunodeficiency <p> A structural problem between the bronchus and the oesophagus , like a fistula between the two tubes , may result in fluid getting into the lungs during drinking or feeding . <p> This could result in an infection of the air sacs , i.e. pneumonia . <p> " Reflux means that when they drink milk , it goes into the stomach , then comes back up again in the opposite direction . <p> " At most , normally , it goes back into the oesophagus . However , sometimes , it can be so severe that the milk moves so far up that it goes into the lungs , " says Dr Norzila . <p> As for children with immunodeficiency , their low immunity means that their body is unable to fight off invading microorganisms , causing them to be at risk for recurrent infections , including pneumonia . <p> Pneumonia is a potentially serious disease that affects many children around the world . <p> While there are preventive measures and lifestyle adjustments you can make to minimise the risk of your children catching this disease , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child has pneumonia , do bring them to the doctor quickly . <p> For more information , email **25;1956;TOOLONG .

@@71752441 <h> How the coronavirus is testing social media 's efforts to stem the flow of fake news amid global public health crisis <p> The novel coronavirus outbreak , which has now spread to 70 countries and infected more than 93,000 people , has also sparked what the World Health Organisation calls an " infodemic " . <p> The internet , including the one behind China 's Great Firewall , has been flooded with false information , most of it related to unverified cures and unproven conspiracy theories , according to AFP Fact Check , which has posted 90 fact-checks since late January when the virus became a serious health crisis in China . <p> The false information includes advice that vitamin D will prevent the virus , boiled garlic water is a cure , or that the deadly virus was created in Canada and stolen by Chinese spies . <p> Fake news is seen as more novel than factual events , which is why people were more likely to share such misinformation , according to a 2018 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . " Whereas false stories inspired fear , disgust , and surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , and trust , " it said . <p> Last month the WHO hosted a meeting in Silicon Valley with American internet giants , including Facebook and Twitter , to discuss ways to crack down on misinformation about the epidemic . <p> WHO is posting information on its official social media accounts , which on Friday were expanded to include the short video platform TikTok , owned by Beijing-based ByteDance and popular with teenagers . <p> " With social media , we 're in a completely different world . It 's not just journalists , it 's not tabloids -- anyone can spread rumours , " said Michel Hockx , a professor of Chinese Literature and Culture at the University of Notre Dame . <p> Misinformation has become an acute issue for western social media since the 2016 US election , with Facebook in particular coming under fire in recent years over its role in communicating fake news and polarising politics . The expanding public health crisis , which has killed almost 3,200 , mostly in China , has provided an opportunity to gauge how effective efforts have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Amid the epidemic , Facebook has taken measures to remove content with false claims and conspiracy theories . It has been working with 56 fact-checking partners in 46 languages to rate fake news and alert users who read or share it if it is false . It also provides free advertising to the WHO and health authorities to enable them to run coronavirus education campaigns on social media , said a company spokeswoman . <p> In contrast , Facebook 's peers have taken a different approach to policing fake news on the virus . A Twitter representative said in an emailed response that it mainly monitors platform manipulation and ensures that credible content appears upfront when users search or look for relevant trends . <p> In a blog post last month TikTok said it is working with third-party fact checking organisations and highlights in-app notices around hashtags related to the coronavirus to remind users of its community guidelines so they do not help spread fake news . <p> In China , WHO has been working closely with internet giants such as Tencent and Weibo to counter rumours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , in China content on social media platforms is strictly controlled by the Cyberspace Administration of China , the nation 's top internet regulator . <p> Last month the CAC said it had punished a number of platforms for publishing content deemed unsuitable and misleading . It also gave " supervision and guidance " to Tencent , Sina and ByteDance which operate the country 's most popular social media platforms . <p> Still , fake news continues to spread despite these efforts . In one case , Poynter , a non-profit journalism institution that owns the International Fact-Checking Network , singled out a widely circulated satellite image of Wuhan city , the outbreak 's epicentre , which claimed to show high levels of sulphur dioxide , supposedly " evidence " that Chinese authorities were cremating thousands of infected people . <p> Fact checkers found that it was not a satellite image , rather it was an air quality forecast based on historical data and weather patterns . Yet the fake news is still being retweeted based on search results using keywords " sulphur dioxide " and " Wuhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hashtag prompts users to access information from regional health authorities and the WHO website . <p> On Facebook , the same fake news report has not been shared since mid-February but some of the existing posts have not been marked with a fake news label . <p> Facebook uses algorithms to generate a pool of potentially false information for fact checkers to rate , based on user feedback , disbelieving comments on the post , or similarity to content that has previously been refuted , according to the company . <p> Twitter 's crackdown on misinformation mainly targets behaviour-based spam content . The company representative said " everyone has a role to play in ensuring misinformation does n't spread on the internet , and we encourage people who use Twitter not to share information unless they can verify that it 's true . " <p> " I do n't think censorship will do much to stop misinformation unless all platforms do it at the same time , " said Niam Yaraghi , an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut who studies the economics of health information technologies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will move to other ones that do not censor and unfortunately users will even trust the alternative platforms more which will make the effect of misinformation worse , " Yaraghi said . <p> In China , social media platforms rely on government-backed sources to verify rumours . Starting late January , the Twitter-like platform Weibo has been sending out a daily digest of false information about the coronavirus that has been refuted by government agencies , state-backed media , the Public Security Bureau and the country 's cyber police . <p> Still , netizens have grown sceptical about the credibility of Chinese government sources since the death of doctor Li Wenliang , one of the first whistle-blowers who tried to share information about the coronavirus in the very early stages , only to be reprimanded by local police . <p> " There is n't a trustworthy authority in China to give people the right information , " Tang said , " The Chinese CDC Center for Disease Control and Prevention is the supporting group of government officials . They do have the information to do investigations but they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tang said he felt " angry " and " sorry " so felt it was necessary to do something himself to help counter the false information . <p> " The reason why Chinese people believe some of those rumours is because the government has proven not to be as reliable as people would expect . The government needs to earn people 's trust , " said Notre Dame professor Hockx . <p> After the death of the whistle-blower doctor , some dissident voices have even been heard from within the government controlled system . The Supreme People 's Court published an article in late January , written by Beijing-based judge Tang Xinghua , that said that some rumours , even if not completely accurate , could be tolerated . <p> With reference to Li and others punished for being whistle-blowers , the judge wrote , " It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had believed the ' rumour ' then and started to wear masks and carried out sanitisation measures , and avoided the wild animal market , " referring to the place believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , the CAC said it had handled 8,277 reports of " harmful " information related to the coronavirus , including using the epidemic to incite negative social sentiment , dissemination of false information and inciting regional discrimination . <p> Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount ( original price US$400 ) .

@@31792941 <h> Who will pay the big lockdown bill ? <p> The government 's extraordinary measures to halt Covid-19 and support the economy have had extraordinary public support . Tony Burton argues that the hard choices about who pays for it will be far less popular . <p> I have lived with a skeleton since the lockdown . It 's white and shiny and takes up half the space in my living area . No one died , though it is a bit creepy at times . The skeleton is the empty frame of a half-built kitchen left behind when the work stopped at the lockdown . For my household bubble , it has been a nuisance having the fridge in the bathroom and having to cook on a barbecue . However , Treasury modelling released on Tuesday suggests this is a mild inconvenience compared to the economic trauma all of us will face over the next few years . <p> Jacinda Ardern showed an understanding of both epidemiological maths and public sentiment when she decided our Covid-19 response should include a lockdown . Close to 90% of New Zealanders support her , yet the choices she must make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have anything like that unanimity of support . They will ultimately decide which generations bear the brunt of paying for the extraordinary stimulus . <p> Professor Neil Ferguson , whose study in the UK is the basis of the scary epidemiological maths , has suggested that " as many as half to two thirds " of those who die with coronavirus would have died by the end of this year regardless of whether or not they caught the disease because most fatalities are among people at the end of their lives or suffering from underlying health conditions . Some healthy people die , as they do every year from the flu , but the main beneficiaries of the lockdown are physically vulnerable people who are no longer working . <p> New Zealand 's approach prioritised the lives of the vulnerable over the economy . To do this , most people in work have indefinite leave and an advance on future wages . So far , $12bn has been committed for these advances , mostly spent on subsidies equivalent to 80% or more wages . When finance minister Grant Robertson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world on a per capita basis " , it was not political hyperbole . In December 2019 , as part of a normal budget process , he set aside $3bn for extra non-capital expenditure ( " operating allowances " ) . Most of that would have been spent on increases to public sector pay and other maintenance of the system , so $12bn on a new initiative is a colossal spend . <p> The Treasury report released on Tuesday provides an economic background to help " weigh up the implications of fiscal and regulatory policy decisions " . It is presented with 2019 as the baseline followed by the current year and four " out years " . In the graphs below , GDP ( incomes ) is in the left-hand graph and unemployment rate on the right . In both , the solid blue line is the projection without Covid-19 . The black lines show what happens with increasingly severe lockdown conditions ( see here for a full summary . ) <p> The wooden skeleton in my house gives a more human sense of the economic dislocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not see work immediately restart on our kitchen . Even a return to level one would mean a week or more of organising plumbers , joiners , painters and polishers . The planner estimates a further six weeks before the backlog of work is cleared . That is the best-case scenario , with children back in school , contractors working without distancing restrictions , and imported items ( like floor polish ) all available . More likely , we will be living with that skeleton for months . A single household kitchen , already planned and budgeted for , is considerably simpler than many economic activities . It is easy to see why the delays and dislocation created by the lockdown mean it will be well into next year before incomes and employment start to recover . <p> Macroeconomic modelling for government is as much a team activity as rugby . The Treasury analysts must have worked under extraordinary difficulties to produce this report in a lockdown . However , for a paper on " fiscal and regulatory policy decisions " , it is strangely quiet about both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it policy-relevant . For instance , they could have estimated debt to GDP ratio and the cost pressure created by servicing more debt . <p> A clue to why these results are in their format : this is how they are normally shown in budget documents . They would have been fed into longer-term fiscal models to put numerical estimates on hard choices about debt , spending levels , and the tax rates needed to make them sustainable . The suspicion must be this paper was created to " manage the authorising environment " . That is , to present scenarios with no policy content to soften up the public for the unpalatable choices that need to be signalled in the 2020 budget . <p> What could these policy choices look like ? There are at least two issues that urgently need to be addressed . There certainly wo n't be 90% support for any of these policy options . <p> Most obvious is how to deal with the cost of the wage advances . In the short term , when faced with a worldwide economic calamity , increasing debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September ( but well within the time covered by budget forecasts ) , a decision needs to be made on what overall debt level we will target and if the extra costs associated with that debt are to be covered by reducing other spending or increasing taxes . <p> These are the kind of extraordinary times when the government might consider extraordinary responses . Will they recognise the main beneficiaries of the lockdown are over-65s and revisit a capital gains tax or consider a surcharge on New Zealand Superannuation ? Both would more evenly distribute the financial costs among generations . Given New Zealand First is in the coalition , and will be implacably opposed to anything touching superannuation , the government is more likely to look at higher taxes for middle and upper-income earners ( $48,000 to $70,000 per year and more than $70,000 per year respectively ) . <p> The other big economic issue is a potential crunch in the labour market . The optimistic Treasury scenario has the unemployment rate tripling this year and staying high for years after that . Getting people back into work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structural shift in the labour market pushing up employment costs . Partly this is an unavoidable consequence of closing borders . Travel bans and quarantine regulations will make skilled migrants think twice about coming here and dissuade many seasonal workers in the agricultural and service sectors . <p> More important in the longer term will be the incentive impact of increasing 2020 benefit rates in line with 2019 wage rises . This is hitting at the same time wages will be falling for two years . The normal response -- in-work payments to improve incentives -- are expensive ( think of the billions spent on Working for Families ) and further add to the hard fiscal choices . If we do not deal with the problem then higher unemployment will become the new normal . <p> Higher taxes and benefit incentives are scary for politicians , far scarier than any skeleton . The next stage of the policy to deal with Covid-19 is going to be very unpopular . <p> Long after a vaccine has been distributed we will likely still be arguing over who bears the financial costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made possible thanks to the support of Kiwi Wealth .

The steam engine , railroads , new machinery and factories , and improved agriculture greatly increased the economy 's productive capacity . More production inevitably leads to more consumption , which in turn leads to more investment . More investment increases production in an ever expanding world of goods . <p> Citizens delighted in the availability of more goods and choices . They could individualize their personalities through their choices of food , clothing and shelter . They could shop endlessly and marvel at the innovative offerings of the producers . <p> Citizens increasingly turned into consumers . Consuming became a lifestyle and culture . Producers profited greatly from the increasing number of active consumers . Producers were eager to stimulate more demand and more consumption . They turned to print advertising and sales calls , and as new media arose , they turned to telemarketing , radio marketing , TV marketing , and Internet marketing . Business firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer desire and purchasing . <p> From the beginning , some onlookers had misgivings about the rise of consumerism . Many religious leaders saw the growing interest of citizens in material goods as competing with religious attention and spiritual values . The legacy of puritanical values kept certain population groups from acquiring too many goods and getting into too much debt . Some citizens were particularly critical of wealthy consumers who used goods to flaunt their wealth . The economist Thorsten Veblen was the first to write about " conspicuous consumption " that he saw as a malady taking people away from more meditative lifestyles . In The Theory of the Leisure Class , Veblen exposed this sickness of status display . Had he lived long enough , he would have been aghast at the news that the former first lady of the Philippines , Imelda Marcos , owned 3,000 pairs of shoes that languished in storage since her exile from the Philippines . <p> The Growing Number of Anti-consumerists <p> There are signs today of a growing anti-consuming movement . We can distinguish at least five types of anti-consumerists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life simplifiers , persons who want to eat less and buy less . They are reacting to the clutter of ' stuff ' . They want to downsize their possessions , many of which lie around unused and unnecessary . Some life-simplifiers are less interested in owning goods such as cars or even homes ; they prefer renting to buying and owning . <p> The second group consists of de-growth activists who feel that too much time and effort are going into consuming . This feeling is captured in William Wordsworth 's poem , <p> " The world is too much with us ... <p> Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers : <p> Little we see in Nature that is ours ; <p> We have given our hearts away , a sordid boon ! " <p> De-growth activists worry that consumption will outpace the carrying capacity of the Earth . In 1970 , the world population was 3.7 billion . By 2011 , the world population grew to 7.0 billion . Today ( 2020 ) , the world population stands at 7.7 billion . The U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2050 . The nightmare would be that the Earth can not feed so many people . The amount of arable land is limited and the top soil is getting poorer . Several parts of our oceans are dead zones with no living marine life . De-growth activists call for conservation and reducing our material needs . They worry about the people in the emerging poor nations aspiring to achieve the same standard of living found in advanced countries , something that is not possible . They see greedy producers doing their best to create ' false and unsustainable needs . ' <p> The third group consists of climate activists who worry about the harm and risk that high buying consumers are doing to our planet through generating so much carbon footprints that pollute our air and water . Climate activists carry a strong respect for nature and science and have genuine concerns about the future of our planet . <p> Fourth , there are sane food choosers who have turned into vegetarians and vegans . They are upset with how we kill animals to get our food . Everyone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit diet . Livestock managers fatten up their cows and chickens to grow fast , and then kill them to sell animal parts in the pursuit of profits . Meanwhile , cows are a major emitter of methane that heats our earth and leads to higher temperatures , faster glacial melting , and flooding of cities . To produce one kilogram of beef , requires between 15,000 and 20,000 liters of water as well as so much roughage to feed the animals . <p> Fifth , we hear about conservation activists who plead not to destroy existing goods but to reuse , repair , redecorate them or give them to needy people . Conservationists want companies to develop better and fewer goods that last longer . They criticize a company such as Zara that produces a new set of women 's clothing styles every two weeks that would only be available only for two weeks . Conservationists oppose any acts of planned obsolescence . They are hostile to the luxury goods industry . Many are environmentalists and anti-globalists . <p> The anti-consumerism movement has produced a growing literature . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , This Changes Everything , and The Shock Doctrine . Also see the documentary film The Corporation by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott . <p> How Businesses Sustain the Consumer Sentiment <p> Business firms have an intrinsic interest in endlessly expanding consumption for the purpose of higher profits . They rely on three disciplines to boost consumption and brand preference . The first is innovation to produce attractive new products and brands to enchant customer interest and purchase . The second is marketing that supplies the tools to reach consumers and motivate and facilitate their purchasing . The third discipline is credit to enable people to buy more than they could normally buy on their low incomes . Businesses aim to make consumption our way of life . To keep their productive equipment and factories going , they must ritualize some consumer behaviour . Holidays like Halloween , Christmas , Easter , Mother 's Day , and Father 's Day are partly promoted to stimulate more purchasing . Businesses want not only purchase of their goods but fast consumption so that objects burn up , wear out , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a hyper-real world of must-have products that claim to deliver happiness and well-being . Businesses refashion commodities into compelling brands that can bring meaning into the consumer 's life . One 's brand choices send a signal of who the person is and what he or she values . Brands bring strangers together to share carefully designed images and meanings . <p> How Will Anti-consumerism Change Capitalism <p> Capitalism is an economic system devoted to continuous and unending growth . It makes two assumptions : ( 1 ) people have an unlimited appetite for more and more goods and ( 2 ) the Earth has unlimited resources to support unlimited growth . Both of these are now questioned . First , many people become jaded and satiated by the effort to continuously consume more goods . Second , the earth 's resources are finite , not infinite , and could not meet the needs of a growing world population that comes with growing material needs . <p> Until now , most countries have used only one measure to assess the performance of their economy . That measure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total value of the goods and services produced in a given year by the country 's economy . What it does n't measure is whether GDP growth has been accompanied by a growth in people 's well-being or happiness . <p> We can imagine a case where GDP grows by 2 or 3 percent by workers working very hard and even at overtime . They only have two weeks of vacation a year . They have little time for leisure or renewal . They might be stressed by unexpected medical bills that hit their savings . They might be unable to send their children to college , leaving their children with lower skills and lower earning potential . Those students who manage to go to college graduate with huge debt . Graduates are carrying a college debt of $1.2 trillion . They can not buy furniture or a home , or even afford to get married . In such a case , we would guess that GDP went up but the nation 's average well-being and happiness went down . <p> We badly need to add new measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing an annual measure of gross domestic happiness ( GDH ) or gross domestic well-being ( GDW ) . We know that citizens in Scandinavian countries enjoy a substantially higher level of happiness and well-being than American citizens and run good economies . Is our addiction to consuming , consuming us ? <p> Part of the problem of economic growth is that the fruits of gains in productivity are not shared equitably . This is obvious in a country with a growing number of billionaires and a great number of poor workers . Many CEOs are paid 300 times what their average worker earns , and some take home as much as 1100 times the average worker . The economic system is rigged . Corporations have succeeded in emasculating trade unions and leaving workers with no say in what they or their bosses should be paid . <p> Even some billionaires are unhappy with this greatly lopsided pay arrangement . Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have publicly called for raising the top income tax rate . This top rate is now down to 37% as a result of the 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70% and manage to run a good economy , one with free health care and free college education . One citizen billionaire , Nick Hanauer has spoken about this on TED . He warns his fellow billionaires that " the pitchforks are coming . " He pleads with them to pay higher wages and taxes and share more of the productivity gains with the working class . The working class should earn enough to eat well , pay rent , and retire with adequate savings . Today there are too many workers who could n't muster $400 to pay for a pressing payment they must make . <p> Capitalism Faces the COVID-19 Crisis <p> Capitalism will change for other reasons as well . If more consumers decide to be anti-consumerists , they will spend less . Their spending has traditionally supported 70% of our economy . If this goes down , our economy contracts in size . A slowdown in economic growth will lead to more unemployment . Add the fact that more jobs are being lost to artificial intelligence ( AI ) and robots . This will require capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food stamps , food kitchens , and social assistance . <p> Capitalism will have to print more money . We see this happening with the $2 trillion outlay voted by Congress to help support desperate workers in the face of the COVID-19 crisis . And $2 trillion is only to tide over the situation in the short run . More trillions will have to be spent . This means huge deficits that ca n't be covered by existing tax revenues . To the extent possible , tax rates will have to be dramatically increased . The lives of the rich are normally not affected by the grief and hardship of the poor . But now it is time for the rich to pay more and share more . In our current crisis , CEOs and their highly paid staffs have to take a cut in their pay . Boeing 's executives recently set an example by saying they will work with no pay during the coming crisis . <p> When the COVID-19 crisis is over , capitalism will have moved to a new stage . Consumers will be more thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume . Here are possible developments : <p> 1 . Some weaker companies and brands will vanish . Consumers will have to find reliable and satisfying replacement brands . <p> 2 . The Coronavirus makes us aware of how fragile our health is . We can catch colds easily in crowds . We must stop shaking hands when we meet and greet . We need to eat more healthy foods to have a greater resistance to germs and flus . <p> 3 . We are shocked by the inadequacy of our health system and its great cost . We need to stay out of the hospital and play safe . <p> 4 . The sudden loss of jobs will remain a trauma even after workers get jobs back . They will spend and save their money more carefully . <p> 5 . Staying home led many consumers to become producers of their own food needs . More home cooking , more gardening to grow vegetables and herbs . Less eating out . <p> 6 . We place more value on the needs of our family , friends and community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to choose good and healthy foods and buy more sensible clothing and other goods . <p> 7 . We will want brands to spell out their greater purpose and how each is serving the common good . <p> 8 . People will become more conscious of the fragility of the planet , of air and water pollution , of water shortages , and other problems . <p> More people will seek to achieve a better balance between work , family and leisure . Many will move from an addiction to materialism to sensing other paths to a good life . They will move to post-consumerism . <p> Capitalism remains the best engine for efficient economic growth . It also can be the best engine for equitable economic growth . It does n't change to socialism when we raise taxes on the rich . We have given up on the false economic doctrine that the poor win when the rich get richer . Actually , the rich will get richer mainly by leaving more money in the hands of working class families to spend . <p> As the coronavirus crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interest of all -- rich and poor alike . It is time to rethink and rewire capitalism and transform it into a more equitable form -- based on democracy and social justice .

@@51680641 <h> COVID-19 Is Exposing Our Communication Weaknesses In A Big Way By Akintola Olaniyan <p> As this virus has shown , the absence of a government communication policy weakens us as a nation in times of crisis . We need to start working on putting one in place . <p> by Akintola OlaniyanMay 04 , 2020 <p> You can be forgiven if you think the present administration 's failure with regards to its communication began only last Monday with that embarrassing leak of the President 's national address . True , there was substantial goodwill when that famous victory was won at the 2015 general election , and the assumption was that beating a sitting president was due to the opposition 's excellent communication before and during the campaign . <p> However , look closely , and you will find that the foundation for the chaotic communication we have witnessed since Coronavirus became an issue was laid in the deception at the heart of that campaign project . The flawed makeover that produced the opposition 's candidate was carefully managed via a network of key people in the traditional media , soi-disant political communication consultants , and slacktivists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it was the money they made from working for the well-funded noise machine created to serve certain political interests . The growing discontent even before last year 's election and the unfolding mess with regards to covid-19 messaging is confirmation that propaganda has its expiry date . The author , Akintola Olaniyan <p> The muddled communication we are seeing in response to Covid-19 may speak to incompetent staffing , but it 's equally evidence of systemic failure as far as communication is concerned . In contrast to South Africa , which I am now privileged to observe at close quarters , it is obvious Nigeria lacks a comprehensive government communication policy . It would be insensitive to blame the present administration for an obvious omission that othersbefore it either failed to spot or knew how to address . However , that the arrogantly efficient noise machine that brought in this administration is failing miserably to support it now , is in itself , an irony . That the noise machine thrived at all in the way that it did is not a confirmation of or existence of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . And herein lies the tragedy of Nigeria and the chaotic communication that is visible today . While Nigeria is drifting , South Africa 's government communication policy guides all engagement at national , provincial , and local levels , and this has been obvious in the Covod-19 response.That document clearly stipulates the developmental aim of government communication , roles of political principals and spokespersons in addition to providing guided steps for every communication engagement for normal and crisis times . Such a detailed communication policy and plan leave no room for confusion and this is clear in the contrasting outcomes of the management of covid-19 . A sound policy response driven by a dedicated Coronavirus website , WhatsApp number and robust consultation with business and other levels of government have shaped the entire South African response and won it praise internationally . You are left in no doubt at all as to what the government is doing because the website and WhatsApp line are well-resourced . In addition to and possibly because it makes all information available , there are rigorous efforts to counteract fake news . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 is liable for prosecution , ' the government website warns . Thisclear messaging at all levels is in stark contrast to the confusion that is threatening to unravel the entire Covid-19 response in Nigeria . A taciturn president and a communication team which in the absence of a clear communication policy appears to be lost , are a terrible combination to have in a crisis . As all communication professionals know , the best thing you do with bad news is to make sure you provide a clear , accurate and concise message , preferably from the very top . What we have had in Nigeria is anything but . Misinformation , mixed-messaging , deliberate withholding of crucial information , have muddled up the messaging , hence the obvious failure to get Nigerians on board . <p> In the absence of the clear , accurate , and concise messaging needed in a time of crisis , their noise machine sought to fill the void with those stories about international agencies praising Nigeria for its handling of the Covid-19 response until their follies were no longer sustainable . While they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their usual manner , there was no evidence of any sound reasoning and willingness to use one if provided . Was there any basis for those early celebrations ? I know we overcame Ebola in commendable fashion , but this is a different kind of virus , and the context is different . Faced with reality , most of them have moved on , citing the relatively low figures of infection in Nigeria as evidence of good work . They are quick to circulate the daily figures from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) pointing out the relatively lower figures in Nigeria compared to other African countries like South Africa.As of Friday , Nigeria had tested only 15,759 people and recorded 2,170 confirmed cases , which is a 13.7% infection rate . In contrast , South Africa hadconducted 217,250 tests and recorded confirmed cases of 5,951 , showing an infection rate of 2.7% . If you were to believe the praise-singers , you would think Nigeria was doing better in the effort to contain Covid-19 ; that 's until you put the figures into proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the story on Covid-19 management is , it is often missing in the narrative . A few other examples illustrate the problem . <p> When Sahara Reporters broke the story that the late Chief of Staff to the President , Abba Kyari , had tested positive to Covid-19 , there was the usual denial , but if that was expected , what followed is an example in how not to communicate during a crisis . Following the audio leak that suggested that he had been smuggled out of the country for treatment , there were suggestions that he was being treated in a Lagos hospital following which state officials denied being aware of his whereabouts . The handling of his infection and treatment left many questioning what was there to hide , especially when the British Prime Minister , Boris Johnson , was seen being wheeled into intensive care unit ( ICU ) following his infection with the virus . It was a missed opportunity to reassure Nigerians and get them behind the effort to fight Covid-19 . If the handling of the treatment was questionable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against the existing rules that Covid-19 corpses would not be handed to their families for burial and prohibiting public gatherings , the late CofS received what looked like a state-backed burial . In itself , the gathering was bad enough , but the video that caught one of the pall-bearers discarding his personal protective equipment ( PPE ) just outside the burial ground in Gudu , Abuja , was a PR disaster of significant proportion . If the government wanted to announce it was not committed to the existing lockdown and the effort to contain Covid-19 , it could not have put together a better strategy . From the statement credited to the Minister of Information , Lai Mohammed , that ' corpses can not be claimed for burial ' to the announcement by a government spokesman , Garba Shehu , that they had received the body , the message was : Do what we say , not what we do . From the video that caught the discarded protective suit to Shehu claiming the government was helpless and could not do have done anything to stop the burial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In allowing the burial to hold , the administration missed a great opportunity to send a strong message that it was on top of Covid-19 . The South African government didexactly that when President Cyril Ramaphosasuspended a cabinet minister for two months and fined her a month 's salary for breaking the lockdown to attend lunch . There have been more missteps that suggest the communication problems run deep . <p> The decision to lockdown only a few states can only be assessed when this is all over , but some of the actions suggest a lack of sound reasoning behind them . For instance , the distribution of palliatives , which was less favourable to Lagos and Ogun states as well as the conflicting signals from Kano State regarding the two-weeks lockdown announced last Monday , suggest policies are still made with little or no data . Such a decision-making process that has defined policy-making in Nigeria is usually shrouded in secrecy , but in crisis situations like Covid-19 , it does a lot more damage . In addition to losing the chance to market government policy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either way , the government struggles with its messaging and loses the people in the process . There would have been no need to worry were it not for Covid-19 , the successful containment of which depends on the cooperation of all Nigerians . I get the feeling government recognizes this because it has asked Nigerians to take responsibility for the fight against the virus going forward . Like all messaging since the first case was reported in Nigeria , this is another one where it is difficult to understand what is intended . Mixed-messaging like this by the administration could leave people unsure whether the government is admitting its lack of capacity to help them or whether it is simply telling Nigerians they were on their own . Either way , it could have been better . As phased reopening of the economy begins today , the relatively low testing and absence of any government policy to assist Nigerians hardest hit by the lockdown , suggest that people are on their own whether or not officials are saying so . Somehow , I am sure Nigeria will make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what happens with our national communication post-Coronavirus , the better .

It took the United Kingdom three years and three prime ministers to fix Brexit -- but only weeks for the bank to return to square one . <p> The once-mighty bank , a symbol of the halcyon days of Hong Kong in the early ' 90s , has performed poorly over the past decade .

Only 21% of New Yorkers tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in recently administered semi-random antibody tests . The dumb media was kind of surprised by this news . One Bloomberg article said the following : <p> " ... the preliminary results appear to confirm predictions that the virus has infected far more people than New York has been able to diagnose . It also means that the fatality rate is likely lower than implied by merely examining confirmed cases and deaths . " <p> Duh ! My 10-year old son is smarter than these journalists who have been mindlessly reporting the " confirmed " case count as if they really indicate the actual extent of COVID-19 infections . He tells me that in our town there must have been at least 1100 people infected with the virus because the death toll stands at 11 . Yet , these journalists still could n't get their heads wrapped around the fact that infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is calculated by dividing the current death count by current confirmed number of cases . <p> Before proceeding further , you have to read this article I wrote more than a month ago . You wo n't appreciate my current predictions without reading that article . <p> Let 's stay one step ahead of mainstream journalists and give you the latest facts about the coronavirus . <p> The COVID-19 death toll in New York State currently stands at 21000 . This is actually a " minimum " for the actual number of COVID-19 deaths in NYS . The correct figure is probably closer to 25000 as a large percentage of non-hospital COVID-19 deaths were gone uncounted in New York State and elsewhere . <p> Once you contract COVID-19 it may take you up to 12 weeks to die or recover . So , we are certain that the number of COVID-19 deaths in NYS will continue to increase through the end of June . We are probably 70-75% done which implies that the death toll in NYS will settle around 32,000 . <p> The figures estimated by Governor Cuomo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 based on the first batch of samples collected . Since it takes up to 14 days for antibodies to develop , I believe this 13.9% figure will creep up towards 17-18% range as they keep collecting samples over the next few weeks . <p> We also do n't know the ratio of false positives and false negatives in New York State 's antibody tests , but it is likely that the percentage of false negatives is much larger than the percentage of false positives . <p> Overall , it looks like the number of total infections in New York State as of today will be around 3.2 million . This tells me that COVID-19 's infection fatality rate is around 1% ( 32K deaths for 3.2 million infections ) . It could be 20% more or less than the 1% figure , depending on where the actual figures end up . However , I think 1% is a nice round estimate that 's very close to the actual infection fatality rate . <p> Now that we have a very robust IFR estimate , we can calculate the IFR for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details ( email me if you 'd have any questions about the methodology ) , here are the results : <p> As you can see from these estimates , COVID-19 is much deadlier than the seasonal flu for people above the age of 40 . <p> What 's the smartest way to reopen New York City ? <p> We know that COVID-19 's IFR is 1% . Current US death toll is near its peak and stands at 50K . This means as we go down the hill , the number of US deaths will reach 100K . This also means there are around 10 million Americans who are infected with the new coronavirus . <p> So far we sucked at testing , tracing , and isolating infected people . That 's why we were forced to implement statewide " stay at home " orders . We also suck at the implementation of " stay at home " orders .

Since the hospitalization rate is around 5% and it takes about 10-14 days to get hospitalized , we can estimate that there were 4000 newly infected people in New York City on April 10th . And that was in the middle of a lockdown . <p> I do n't think we are going to have the political determination in most states in this country to reduce the number of actively infected and contagious people down to manageable levels . This requires at least another 4-6 weeks of strict nationwide lockdowns , and desperate people are already protesting against lockdowns . The number of job losses already exceeded 26% and our GDP is on its way to register double digit declines . We even experienced negative oil prices which crashed the United States Oil Fund , LP ( NYSE:USO ) . Even though the S&amp;P 500 Index is down only around 13% year-to-date , that 's mostly because of bailouts and trillions of stimulus spending pumped into the system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our next best strategy is mitigation and herd immunity . For herd immunity we probably need around 50-60% of New Yorkers infected with the virus . Currently 21% of New Yorkers are already infected . This figure is probably closer to 25% for the reasons I explained above . <p> Nearly 53% of New Yorkers are under the age of 40 . We can allow these younger New Yorkers to go back to their normal lives , get infected , and get closer to developing herd immunity .

That leaves people like Rosa and Judith without any safety net . <p> " Even if they do their taxes , there is no special help for unauthorized workers during the pandemic , " Alejandro P ? rez , a Phoenix lawyer specializing in labor law , explained .

@@61759441 <h> 13 of the Most Deadly Diseases in Human History <p> Amid the far-reaching global impact of the coronavirus , Bill Gates recently described COVID-19 as the " once-in-a-century pathogen we 've been worried about . " After the recent explosions of case numbers over the last couple of weeks , and as confirmed by Bill Gates in his article for the New England Journal of Medicine , COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on our planet . This is not just because of the quarantine but because of how dangerous the virus is . <p> " There are two reasons that COVID-19 is such a threat . First , it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems , " says Gates . " The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1% ; this rate would make it many times more severe than typical seasonal influenza , putting it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic ( 0.6% ) and the 1918 influenza pandemic ( 2% ) . " <p> Currently , there are 1,364,271COVID-19 cases , 76,439 deaths , and 293,843 recovered patients . Physical distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease . Though things are up in the air regarding when the world will return to normal , if history has taught us anything , humanity will make it through this , with researchers working day and night to develop treatments . <p> As you have probably recently learned , contagious diseases have shaped the world and our history , impacting the environment , global economies , and even how humans evolve . Today we are going to explore some of the world 's most infectious diseases . <h> 1 . Ebola <p> Do you remember the Ebola scare a couple of years ago ? Though the disease is very rare , it is extremely deadly , often a fatal infection to those who get it . Caused by one of five strains , the Ebola virus usually spreads through a human 's bodily fluids with most people getting the disease by touching the surfaces of clothing that are contaminated by these fluids . Ebola is known to spread extremely fast , rapidly taking over the body 's immune system causing muscle pain , headaches , weakness , diarrhea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . <p> With an average fatality rate of about 50%and with a case fatality rate varying from 25% to 90% , Ebola is truly terrifying . A recent outbreak of Ebola caught the world 's attention in 2014 and lasted until 2016 . As many as 11,325 people died during the outbreak while 28,652 people said to have been infected by the disease . <p> In 2018 , there was also another outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that took the lives of well over 2,000 people . Combating Ebola is not easy as there is no proven treatment for the virus . Yet , there are currently experimental vaccines and treatments being tested to combat future outbreaks . <h> 2 . Marburg virus <p> First identified in 1967 , the Marburg virus shares some similarities with ebola because of its ability to also cause hemorrhagic fever . In short , this means that people that have the Marburg virus suffer from similar symptoms like fever and bleeding throughout the body . If not properly treated , the disease can lead to a series of organ failures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lab , the mortality rate hovered around 25% . Yet , when the disease reappeared between 1998- 2000 , that number skyrocketed to above 80%. <h> 3 . Smallpox <p> Some researchers have argued that Smallpox could make a comeback . Yet , as of 1980 , the World Health Assembly declared that the world is smallpox free . Historically , smallpox is considered to be one of the most dangerous and historic diseases . Caused by the variola virus , the disease produces a characteristic rash , particularly on the face , arms and legs . Before the vaccine in the 1980s , Smallpox existed for 3,000 years and was one of the most feared diseases in history . Only in the 20th century , smallpox is believed to have killed 300 million people . Smallpox is still talked about as both the WHO and countless governments around the world believe that viruses could be deliberately released to cause harm . <h> 4 . Dengue <p> Mosquito-borne diseases kill millions of people each year . One of the most devastating diseases affecting the world is Dengue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The viral infection appears in its victim after being transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito , with symptoms usually appearing 3-14 days after the infective bite . Even more so the disease affects people of all ages as each person battles flu-like symptoms , which at times can lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever , which could also include symptoms that include fever , abdominal pain , vomiting , bleeding , and trouble in breathing . At the moment there are no treatments for Dengue. <h> 5 . Hantavirus <p> Also known as HPS , Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caught the attention of the United States back in 1993 when a healthy young man died of the disease after only a couple days of experiencing shortness of breath . The rare but very deadly disease is caused by a virus that a person gets from getting in contact with the droppings , saliva , or urine of a rodent . People who have been unfortunate enough to get the disease have experienced fever , chills , muscle aches , or gastrointestinal symptoms . Thankfully the researchers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . Yet there have been 600 cases in the U.S. of people contracting HPS with a 36% mortality rate . <h> 6 . Meningitis <p> It is one of the most terrifying diseases on this list . Referring to the inflammation of the meninges , or the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord , the disease can be caused by a wide array of things that include but are not limited to fungi , viruses , and bacteria . Viral meningitis can be spread through the sharing of bodily fluids . Even kissing can spread bacterial meningitis . When not treated immediately meningitis can have a mortality rate as high as 50%. <h> 7 . Malaria <p> Another mosquito based disease , the world health organization has estimated that there have been 228 million cases of malaria in 2018 alone , with most cases occurring in the African Region . About 405,000 people died in 2018 from this curable and preventable disease due to the massive influx of mosquitoes in the region . The parasite makes its way from mosquito to host , causing those infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to serious complications . At the moment , leading private organizations , WHO , and governments are working hard to dramatically drop the number of cases of the infected each year . <h> 8 . SARS <p> SARS , the severe acute respiratory syndrome , caused the deaths of 750 people in a pandemic in 2002 and 2003 . The current belief is that just like other deadly diseases like Ebola virus , Marburg virus , and MERS , the disease originated from bats , with the first infected appearing in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002 . Symptoms of the disease include fever , malaise , myalgia , headache , diarrhea , and shivering. <h> 9 . Influenza <p> During a typical season , up to 500,000 people worldwide die from Influenza . However , as we have seen new flu strains emerge causing a massive pandemic . One of the most deadly cases of flu to happen in recent history is the 1918 Spanish flu that sickened up to global 40% of the population eventually killing about 50 million people . Though some have argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for , there is still a chance that we could experience a pandemic much worse than COVID-19 in the coming years . Simple things like washing your hands and getting a regular flu shot can help combat standard influenza. <h> 10 . Cholera <p> When untreated , Cholera can be extremely deadly , killing within hours . Acute diarrhoeal infection is caused by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with the bacterium " Vibrio cholera " and is one of the most deadly diseases in developing countries . It is believed that there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera with death numbers expected to be somewhere between 21,000 - 143,000 . Upon drinking or eating infected food , symptoms tend to appear within 12 hours to 5 days . WHO is working on preventing cholera in countries is by collaborating with organizations to provide clean water and sanitation facilities . <h> 11 . HIV <p> Throughout the world , HIV is considered to be one of the deadliest viruses . Human immunodeficiency virus is considered by the World Health Organization to be a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 32 million people since it has been discovered . The virus targets the immune system destroying crucial cells in the body , drastically inhibiting your body from fighting infection . The cells , also known as CD4 cells , are hijacked by HIV replicating themselves inside in CD4 destroying the cells . <p> The good news is , there have been a lot of great breakthroughs in HIV research . According to the WHO , almost 40 million people are living with the disease , with a large portion of the infected able to manage it and live with it . Moreover , 2 people have just been cured of what was once thought of as the incurable disease thanks to a stem cell transplant . <h> 12 . Rabies <p> Though rabies is not that big of a threat in the west , with most people having complete access to rabies vaccines for pets , in places like India or Africa rabies is a serious issue . The viral disease directly attacks the nervous system , affecting any warm-blooded animals , usually coming in contact with is salvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entering of an existing wound . Interestingly , 40% of people bitten by suspected rabid animals are children under 15 years of age , while 99% of rabies transmissions are from dogs to humans . By 2030 , the World Health organization aims to get human rabies-related deaths down to zero . <h> Plague <p> As we mentioned above , smallpox is erased from the world . However , the following ancient killer is still very much with us appearing in places around the world . Plague is an infectious disease responsible for wiping out about 33% of the population in Europe during the 14th century , about 50 million people . It is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis carried by small mammals and their fleas . <p> Taking septicaemic and pneumonic forms the deadly disease can have a case-fatality ratio of 30% - 100% if left untreated . Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo , Madagascar , and Peru have all reported cases of Plague .

@@51698641 <h> COVID-19 and Nigerian Banks , By Reuben Abati <p> Before COVID-19 , one of the problems Nigerian banks faced was that of over-regulation by the Central Bank . Regulatory high-handedness hampered the capacity of the banks . Many of the banks also faced the threat of deteriorating credit quality due to over-exposure , particularly to ailing sectors -- oil and gas and the power companies . COVID-19 , collapsing oil prices and naira devaluation turned the crisis in the banking sector into a triple whammy . <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the entire world -- the future of everything and the world of work , but perhaps the most visible effect of this disruption is most felt in the financial services sector , the markets and the global economy . In this regard , the banking sector is one of the most gravely impacted . It would be useful to reflect a little on the extent to which this is so in Nigeria and the meaning of the multi-dimensional implications , and hopefully , someday , someone will take on the task of analysing , in greater detail , bank-customer relations and the role of the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to provide a preliminary sketch , throw up a few posers and make some observations . <p> When on March 29 , Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced the imposition of an initial two-week lockdown on Lagos and Ogun States and the Federal Capital Territory , the three parts of the country that had then presented a higher COVID-19 sero-prevalence , he exempted healthcare workers , security personnel , pharmaceutical companies , oil company workers , the country 's food supply chain , the media , and other essential workers . His speech made no mention of the banks . <p> This omission was addressed the following day , March 30 , by the minister of Finance , Budget and National Planning and the governor of the Central Bank , who further informed the public that Nigerian banks/money markets would also be expected to provide essential services during the period of the lockdown . Obviously , during the period , Nigerians would need money , either in terms of access to cash or the completion of pending transactions , transfers , payments and savings . In April , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet by another week , towards the end of the month . As it turned out , other states of the federation relying on Section 8 of the Quarantine Act and enabling state laws also enforced their own versions of the lockdown . Effectively , Nigeria became part of the global response to COVID-19 . People were asked to stay at home , stay safe , follow guidelines , and avoid the risk of infection and transmission . It all happened so suddenly , so unexpectedly . Nobody was prepared for it . There were reports of harvests of death in Europe , Asia , and the Americas . Fear gripped the world . Panic reigned . People asked the inevitable question : Will humanity survive , given the virulence of the virus ? As people stayed at home and off the streets , they still needed to survive . Nobody had withdrawn cash or saved towards emergencies such as COVID-19 . The importance of access to the banks and to cash was writ large ; earning an income became a matter of life and death for households and businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which only the fittest survived . The banks in Nigeria were not of much help . Their rating in terms of customer relations/support fell . <p> The banks simply refused to open their doors to customers . The few that pretended to do so in Lagos provided only skeletal services . People were advised to make withdrawals using Automated Teller Machines ( ATMs ) , but most of these machines had no cash supply , and where they had , long queues could be seen daily , without anyone observing the physical distancing guidelines . Digital banking transactions , which has been touted as the new way of the world , proved difficult . If you went directly to an open branch , you would be kept waiting by a gateman who knew nothing about banking . He would return later to tell you that the officer hidden inside the banking hall would need to contact someone at the headquarters . Many account officers who attended to the middle class were also under quarantine . Their phones were switched off . A major pillar of the banking business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their own survival more seriously . The customer was no longer king ! COVID-19 is the great destroyer of all known norms . It has shifted paradigms and turned the table against all known norms . <p> When on one occasion , I had cause to protest , I was told that the banks were also being careful . They needed to protect their staff . They would not allow customers to bring the virus into their banking halls . They had also recorded quite a few cases of fraud during the lockdown . So does that justify the scarcity of cash at cash points and the epileptic e-banking platforms ? It will be recalled that the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced a Financial Inclusion Strategy in 2016 , the objective of which was to promote electronic banking and mobile money transactions . This led to the increasing digitalisation of banking transactions in the country and the emergence of such features as the use of POS , e-banking and payment service agents . Whereas this has been hailed as a progressive development , Nigeria remains far behind other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial inclusion has been recorded . Nigeria 's slow penetration rate in this regard was exposed by the COVID-19 lockdown and indeed in reality , Nigeria remains under-banked ; its banking practices are still far behind . <p> But even then , bank customers are still unhappy , particularly in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory . The banks remain an index of the people 's frustration . From May 4 till date , the premises of virtually every bank has been a war zone . Customers besiege the banks daily , without caring about either physical or social distancing rules . They sit outside or they queue up in a long , snaky stretch . <p> For many subsistence workers whose survival depends on daily work , the banking situation was worse because these blue-collar workers live or suffer , relative to their daily hustle . Whatever work that linked them to the banking value-added chain was cut off . The extended family community that often helps to bridge the gap in Africa , was also adversely affected . Nigerians in Diaspora whose financial remittances constitute a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ran into troubled waters . In every sense , Nigeria 's financial sector faced a severe respiratory crisis , with corresponding implications for economic growth and social stability . It did n't take long before Nigerians , especially the youth , became restive . A social crisis loomed large in the horizon . In Lagos and Ogun States , neighbourhoods were attacked by those who called themselves " One Million Boys " . The rich became afraid of their own shadows . Nigerian banks had to take extra security measures . Organised labour and the organised private sector began to push the argument that the lockdown would not work in Africa , and that it was better government re-opened the business space . <p> On April 27 , it may be said that the federal government succumbed to pressure , when in a nationwide broadcast , President Muhammadu Buhari announced a " phased and gradual " easing of the lockdown in the Federal Capital Territory , Ogun and Lagos States , with the same advice for other parts of the federation , subject to their own peculiar circumstances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State chose to defer its own relaxation of the lockdown by a week , having joined a week later than the FCT and Lagos State . On May 17 , the State announced yet a further extension of the lockdown . Other states of the federation again took their cue from the federal government in due course . Delta , Ebonyi , Katsina , and Borno states have since allowed mosques and churches to re-open . Kaduna State and others have also announced relaxed measures . Across the country , a curfew remains in place from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m . Inter-state travel has been banned , even if there are concerns about the movement of the almajirai across state borders , with many of them testing positive for COVID-19 . In the face of new guidelines , banks also opened their doors . <p> But even then , bank customers are still unhappy , particularly in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory . The banks remain an index of the people 's frustration . From May 4 till date , the premises of virtually every bank has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without caring about either physical or social distancing rules . They sit outside or they queue up in a long , snaky stretch . The people seem determined to die , if possible , just to gain access to their bank accounts . The queues are long . The desperation is palpable . A few banks have since provided tents and chairs in front of their branches . I wo n't be surprised if in the third week of the easing of the lockdown , some Nigerian banks also begin to provide mattresses and mats ! Those queues may not disappear unless the banks open up more branches and pay better attention to customer care . <p> Just how serious this is , was brought to the fore in a now popular and sensational video , showing the chairman of Ikwerre Local Government in Rivers State , Samuel Nwanosike , who led a mini-task force to a branch of the United Bank for Africa ( UBA ) to disperse a crowd of bank customers , who did not wear face masks , and did not observe physical or social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , Nwanosike asked the bank officials , angrily . " Who is the bank manager here ? ... Who is the second in command ? " One bank official told him : " The people are not listening to us " . There may be a lot to learn from this as all businesses adjust to a " new normal " , occasioned by a capricious virus . <p> The banks and their sympathisers insist , however , that they do not deserve any blame , vulnerable as they are , like every other business , without any measurable support from either government or their regulator , and yet they continue to play their part as responsible corporate citizens . There is probably a point here : It is on record that the banks and their CEOs enthusiastically joined the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 , known as CA-COVID , which has so far raised over N27 billion . It is part of the burden that banks face that many of their customers think that the donations should have been given to them directly , since the banks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of seeking tax reliefs , and their CEOs , of promoting their own individual egos . <p> The plug on job cuts , or the furloughing of bank staff is at best the postponement of the evil day . Bank staff , as well as other employees , must prepare for the worst . Many businesses will end up as part of the COVID-19 death rate statistics . Jobs will die too . Previous pandemics posted a V-shaped recovery trajectory . There are no such guarantees this time around . <p> But perhaps the biggest challenge for Nigerian banks , and the extent of their vulnerability , emerged when a tele-conference video was leaked , showing the CEO of Access Bank , Herbert Wigwe , in which he announced that Access Bank was going to cut staff salaries and retrench staff as part of its business continuity and sustainability plans in the context of a public health crisis that has crippled business . The leakage of the Access Bank video was met with outrage . Wigwe was called names . The Bank was abused . A few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama , announced that no bank is allowed to cut any job without its express approval , and that indeed job cuts in the banking sector are forbidden at this time . Access Bank denied the video that was in circulation . Stakeholders may accuse Nigerian banks of lapses in the face of COVID-19 but the truth is that the attack on Wigwe and Access Bank was totally unwarranted . In my view , Wigwe showed leadership and was honest . <p> The only " COVI-diot " in the Access Bank matter is the disloyal staff who leaked the content of an in-house conversation . No serious organisation should condone that kind of treachery . Wigwe says salaries will be cut and branches will be rationalised . Last year , Access Bank acquired Diamond Bank in one of the biggest merger and acquisitions that the Nigerian banking sector has witnessed in the past decade . Since that merger , Access Bank has not rationalised staff or branch networks . It simply inherited all the branches and staff that belonged to the defunct Diamond Bank , resulting in a situation where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank on the same street . Access Bank may have chosen the wrong time to announce its business re-design plan , but it is confronted with a reality that every business would have to deal with . But the question should be asked : Is it part of the work of the regulator to dictate cost and business models ? <p> Before COVID-19 , one of the problems Nigerian banks faced was that of over-regulation by the Central Bank . Regulatory high-handedness hampered the capacity of the banks . Many of the banks also faced the threat of deteriorating credit quality due to over-exposure , particularly to ailing sectors -- oil and gas and the power companies . COVID-19 , collapsing oil prices and naira devaluation turned the crisis in the banking sector into a triple whammy . Micro-finance banks are losing over N45 billion uncollected loans . To all intents and purposes , it is part of the role of the Central bank to protect the banks and stave off the possibility of corrosive stress . Elsewhere we have seen central banks intervening to protect the banking sector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas -- to protect SMEs , pharmaceuticals , loans , the manufacturing sector , agriculture , but it has done little to strengthen the capacity of banks to survive as businesses . <p> The plug on job cuts , or the furloughing of bank staff is at best the postponement of the evil day . Bank staff , as well as other employees , must prepare for the worst . Many businesses will end up as part of the COVID-19 death rate statistics . Jobs will die too . Previous pandemics posted a V-shaped recovery trajectory . There are no such guarantees this time around . A U-shaped recovery scenario may even be optimistic . Many economies will sink in an L-shaped format . And that is where leadership matters . What should leaders do in relation to economic risks and the structural legacy of COVID-19 ? This is the kind of rigorous thinking we need to see , instead of the same government that wants to implement the Oronsaye Report , cut cost and ensure economic sustainability , telling banks and other businesses that they can not cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of the COVID-19 tragedy so far points to serious issues of governance .

Richard Rogers , a major benefactor behind the garden , has called for replacement of the museum 's director , Mark Masuoka , following news about employees ' claims that he failed to address a culture of racism , sexism and bullying of employees by managers.The Plain Dealer <p> AKRON , Ohio -- A major Akron Art Museum donor who served as a trustee and board chairman there issued an open letter Thursday saying the museum has failed to respond adequately to allegations of racism , sexism and bullying of employees by managers . <p> In the letter , Richard Rogers , a museum trustee from 1998 to 2007 and chairman of its board from 2005 to 2007 , calls for the replacement of the museum 's management team , including Mark Masuoka , its director since 2013 . <p> " It could be done through a resignation or a replacement by the board , ' ' Rogers said in an interview Thursday morning . " Of course , the longer that this management team stays in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become . " <p> Masuoka declined to comment in an email Thursday afternoon . Dr. Drew Engles , the museum 's current board president , and a hand and microvascular Surgeon at Akron Children 's Hospital , did not respond to a request for comment made in Thursday morning . <p> Rogers , with his wife , Alita , donated more than $2 million to build the one-acre Bud and Susie Rogers Garden at the museum , completed in 2016 and named for Rogers ' parents . <p> In his letter , Rogers said five generations of his family have " made a substantial commitment of time and money in support of the institution . " <p> The Rogers letter follows news stories last week about a June 2019 complaint letter anonymously sent to trustees by 27 employees . <p> First reported by ARTnews , the letter claimed that Masuoka and Chief of Staff and then director of special projects Jennifer Shipman had " created and promoted a pervasive culture of race and gender discrimination and bullying which have resulted in a dysfunctional work environment and severely unhealthy turnover rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffing related to loss of revenue caused by the closure of the museum in response to the coronavirus pandemic were in fact an attempt to remove employees involved in the anonymous complaint . The museum denies the claim . <p> Masuoka , whose salary is more than $170,000 , has not responded to several calls requesting comment . Shipman , who left the museum and now works in Los Angeles , said in an email last week " The allegations concerning my name are simply not true and do not accurately represent my professionalism and character . " <p> Following the 2019 allegations , the museum 's board hired Kastner Westman &amp; Wilkins , an Akron law firm , to investigate and make recommendations . <p> On Monday , Engles , the museum 's current board president , posted a letter to museum members saying that " prompt , appropriate and specific actions were then taken by the Museum Board to comprehensively and directly address any substantiated allegations .

The letter then said that the museum initiated anti-bias training in early February . The letter did not explain why the museum waited six months to start the training . <p> In his letter , Rogers , a retired past president of BW Rogers Co. , a distributor of electromechanical , hydraulic and pneumatic motion control products and systems , said he felt compelled to speak out " after watching the tragedy at the Akron Art Museum unfold in the national and local press , seeing the recent feeble and defensive response to the public , and learning that the plans are to keep the leadership team in place .

" On this measure alone we have an unequivocal failure . It 's also a big embarrassment to the City of Akron . " <p> Rogers added that in light of the recent news stories about the June 2019 complaint by employees , " I expected the prompt resignation of the current management team and a fresh approach .

I have personally observed inappropriate , aggressive bullying behavior from a past president and inaccurate , dismissive , and belittling comments about employees from others . Rogers declined Thursday morning to provide details on his personal observations . <p> " The root cause of this fiasco is bad board leadership , lack of enforcement of good governance , and failure to follow proven best practices like board orientation and training , a human resource function , and routine review of the executive director . ' ' <p> Rogers called the museum 's present troubles " a preventable disaster . " <p> He said that " when I learned of the brewing troubles with the staff in June of 2019 , I made repeated attempts in writing and in person to express my concerns to the board 's executive committee . It fell on deaf ears . In fact the board actively tried to discredit me .

We thank everyone for their ongoing contributions to this important Akron institution . " <p> Engles also praised Masuoka for closing the Akron Art Museum in March ahead of the stay-at-home order issued by Gov . Mike DeWine related to the coronavirus pandemic . <p> Neither the Engles letter nor a press release issued by the museum last week responded to the criticisms of Masuoka leveled by employees in the 2019 letter . <p> Note : This story has been updated to indicate that Mark Masuoka , director of the Akron Art Museum , declined comment . <p> Note to readers : if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission .

@@71917741 <h> Tackling future Covids : Three things India needs to learn from China <p> We have an excellent disaster preparedness machinery . But it 's time to have a disease preparedness system as well . <p> Employees are back at work at the construction site of the Wuhan Greenland Center , a 636-m high skyscraper in Wuhan in China 's central Hubei province . ( AFP ) <p> China 's approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus has been called many things , many contradictory things . Just for instance , the strict lockdown and aggressive social distancing measures have been termed draconian ; at the same time , the measures adopted in Wuhan , which were nothing but lockdown and social distancing , have been called effective as well . So when we in India look at how China wrested control over the coronavirus outbreak , we do so in part admiration at Beijing 's ruthless efficiency , and part alarm at the disregard for citizen liberties . <p> While ideological differences over civil liberties will always separate India and China , New Delhi would do well to look hard at the measures enforced by Beijing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters into a key phase of its own battle against the novel coronavirus nCoV19 , it would benefit immensely from the insights available from the Chinese experience . <p> The most important of such insights would be that China did not win its battle with one fell blow . If one became aware of the coronavirus outbreak only when China employed all its state power to quarantine Wuhan and no less than 12 neighbouring cities , one might be misled into believing that one sledgehammer blow was all that it took to gain an upper hand on the epidemic . In fact , China did not use one single measure or policy : it adopted multifaceted and calibrated containment tactics based on an epidemic combat strategy finessed over 15 years . <p> Here are three things that China did that we can learn from as we go into the most crucial phase of the coronavirus epidemic in India . <p> 1 . Nationwide disease surveillance infrastructure <p> In China , measures to detect vicious outbreaks such as Covid-19 were put in place right after the SARS outbreak in 2003 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as 2004 . Called the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System ( NIDRIS ) , it is a web-based system for health facilities to report , in real time , individual case information of 39 notifiable infectious diseases . The NIDRIS system tracks approximately 5 million cases each year . The database connects hospitals and clinics at the prefecture , county , provincial and national levels , allowing the China Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ) to monitor an outbreak at every level . <p> Besides incidence reporting , China 's surveillance infrastructure includes an early warning system to detect the unusual occurrence of 33 infectious diseases . Set up by the WHO and China CDC in 2008 , the China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System ( CIDARS ) facilitates the transmission of surveillance data in real time or on a daily basis . The 33 diseases in CIDARS are classified as Type 1 ( high severity but low incidence ) or Type 2 ( common infectious diseases ) . CIDARS tracks diseases that are outbreak-prone and transmits information about any abnormal signals to the CDCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four components : aberration detection , signal generation , signal dissemination and signal response information feedback . <p> How does this system work ? Since lower respiratory infections including pneumonia are one of the main causes of death worldwide , all Chinese healthcare facilities are required to report any patient who has a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology and meets the following criteria : fever &gt;= 38 degrees C ; radiological characteristics of pneumonia ; normal or reduced leucocyte count or low lymphocyte count ; no improvement/worsening of patient 's condition for first 3-5 days ; and the pneumonia can not be attributed to alternative laboratory or clinical diagnosis . <p> After a case is registered in NIDRIS , the data can be further analysed in CIDARS as a Type 1 disease . Early alert signals are sent out when the number of cases exceeds the threshold for each infection . The thresholds for each disease are recommended by China CDC . Early warnings in the form of real-time SMSs are followed by a field investigation to rule out avian influenza , SARS and MERS . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all epidemic staff at CDCs at the national , provincial , city and county levels . <p> It may be true that in spite of having the infrastructure outlined above , China was slow to respond when the Wuhan outbreak happened . In fact , several studies of China 's disease surveillance infrastructure point out that although physicians are required to report pneumonia of unknown etiology , there is evidence of under-reporting . However , the purpose of the system is to detect clusters of pneumonia that indicate an outbreak . It gives the administration a better chance to react fast . <p> In contrast , India 's disease surveillance infrastructure is coordinated through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme ( IDSP ) but is beset with limitations . According to a roundtable discussion between healthcare experts organised by Carnegie India in December 2019 , the disease surveillance infrastructure model in India lacks uniformity of case definitions , standards and practices at the state and national levels . Also , there was a lack of coordination among competing organisations that resulted in ineffective disease mapping . Additionally , a research article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data on infectious disease burden in India . <p> In any scenario , there is consensus on what ought to be India 's biggest learning from the coronavirus experience : invest heavily in disease surveillance at all levels . <p> 2 . Contact tracing <p> In the current coronavirus crisis , digital surveillance and data analytics have emerged as important tools in epidemic control . China was fortunate in this matter , and gained time by turning to the massive amounts of data collected by companies like Tencent and Alibaba to perform contact tracing . These companies actually have a better idea of population and migration patterns than the Chinese government . Leveraging this data enabled orderly contact tracing of infected citizens and at-risk individuals . <p> On the other hand , many countries battling the coronavirus have given up on contact tracing fairly quickly although it is an effective , inexpensive and very basic public health intervention , compared to policies like social distancing , which have great economic costs . <p> Measures to trace the location and movement of millions of mobile phone users were put into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alibaba and Tencent . For instance , Ant Financial 's QR code system assigns users one of three colors -- green , yellow or red -- based on the user 's basic healthcare information , travel history and location . The close-contact detector apps use big data from public authorities about train and air travel history and disease case records to check if the user has been in contact with an infected person . A green code permits freedom of movement , while yellow and red indicate that the user must self-quarantine or enter supervised quarantine . The right of admission into cafes , malls and other establishments is conditional on what code you have been assigned at that moment . <p> 3 . Mobility Controls <p> Beijing 's initial response to the Wuhan outbreak is being questioned but the agility of its action in that city in the third week of January is widely acknowledged . After more than 100 cases were detected on January 21 , mobility controls were announced in Wuhan on January 23 : the airport was closed ; bus , subway and train services were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . The lockdown measures were put in place days before the Chinese New Year holiday , when millions of people travel around and out of the country . By 24 January , travel restrictions were extended to 12 prefecture-level cities in Hubei . <p> In a study published in the journal Science , researchers estimated that the lockdown and mobility controls prevented 700,000 additional coronavirus cases and gave 130 cities extra time ( 3-5 days ) to prepare for the outbreak . The scale and agility of the lockdown involving 60 million people in Hubei has been the subject of much awe , but mobility controls went beyond a lockdown . <p> Keeping people indoors meant supplying supermarkets and stores with enough food to ensure people did n't have to leave their homes . In India , we have witnessed the exodus of millions of migrant labourers shortly after a lockdown was announced because they were not assured of food , residence and essential services in the cities . Anticipating that people would hoard food items and venture out of their homes in search of essentials , the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubei . <p> The city of Shouguang , in Shandong , is the country 's most important hub for growing , trading and shipping vegetables . The city is critical to China 's food production and distribution , so much so that the daily benchmark of national produce costs is called the China Shouguang Vegetable Price Index . Shouguang produces 4.5 million tonnes of vegetables every year and even more produce moves through its wholesale markets to reach other parts of China . Shouguang activated emergency plans to continue producing and delivering vegetables into Wuhan after it was asked to deliver 600 tonnes of fresh vegetables to Wuhan everyday for two weeks starting on 29 January . Officials also coordinated with provinces around Hubei to amass a reserve of 60,000 tonnes of vegetables and readied 10,000 tonnes of frozen pork in Shanghai that could be sent to Wuhan anytime . To facilitate the distribution of fresh produce , the government exempted food delivery trucks from travel restrictions and cracked down on price gouging at supermarkets in Wuhan . <p> The author is a China scholar and former research officer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

What We Need is Trust ' <p> Amid several reports of attacks on healthcare personnel engaged in treating and tracking COVID-19 cases across the country , the Cabinet , on Wednesday , 22 April , approved an ordinance to amend the Epidemic Act of 1897 , making acts of violence against health workers a cognisable and non-bailable offence , punishable with prison terms . <p> How important is this ordinance in the fight against COVID-19 ? Why is there violence against healthcare workers ( HCWs ) during this pandemic ? <p> To understand that , we need to understand the history and the sociological context of a pandemic or epidemic . Before analysing this violence and the ordinance , it needs to be reiterated that any violence is unacceptable and must be condemned . <h> ' Transactional ' Model of Healthcare Must Change <p> Violence against healthcare workers , particularly doctors and hospital staff , has been almost endemic in India , the last few decades .

According to a report of a Parliamentary Standing Committee in 2016 , nearly 63 million people are pushed below the poverty line every year because of healthcare debts . <p> As the contract between private healthcare providers and patients has become more of a business deal rather than service , as is the nature of ' business deals ' everywhere , everyone wants the biggest bang for the buck . <p> In this environment , when people are forced to shell out large amounts of money for healthcare and the results are not what they expect , they take to violence . This is somewhat similar to the over-privatised model of healthcare in the US , where the violence is not physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare delivery , laws alone might not succeed in changing the increasingly confrontational relationship between healthcare providers and the people . This law goes further to put the two sections at ' war ' . <p> To begin with , the government needs to invest more than a measly 1.2 percent of India 's GDP on healthcare to reduce people 's burden of healthcare expenses . Most countries with a decent public health system in the Lower Middle Income Group ( LMICs ) to which India also belongs , spends roughly 2.5-3 percent of GDP on public health . In India , that has been an unkept promise for over a decade . <p> The violence is also related to a lack of training in communication and interpersonal behaviour among medical students and resident doctors . <p> When high stress situations in the ER or ICU take a turn for the worse , they find themselves inadequately equipped to deal with it . <p> The nature and the reasons for the violence during this pandemic are somewhat different , however .

This arises from the stigmatisation and ostracisation of patients or suspected patients of COVID-19 , and of certain communities along the lines of religion . This has led to people feeling isolated , threatened and vulnerable . <h> COVID is an ' Invisible Enemy ' : A Dangerous Narrative <p> There is also an associated element of vigilantism against patients/suspected patients , part of a widespread and growing lynch-culture in the country . When governments and healthcare systems talk of the virus as an invisible and untreatable ' enemy ' , it has dangerous consequences . <p> The lack of understanding , irrationality and fear that it generates , leads a section of people to find a ' visible enemy ' to attack . <p> The war rhetoric used by governments has made a difficult situation worse .

If there is a 1 per cent loss of life , that would be a catastrophic loss of human life .

John Neely Kennedy ( R-LA ) <p> Quickly now , when I say coronavirus pandemic and a federal response , what 's the first thing that pops into your head ? I bet whatever it was did n't have anything to do with climate change . <p> Well , think again -- as I try to explain why Democrats and the clean energy and climate defense sectors proposed a series of climate-related initiatives as part of the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act ( the Cares Act or Act ) which will be signed into law within days . The connection between climate change and stimulus legislation intended to respond to the coronavirus pandemic is not as tenuous as it might seem at first blush . <p> Greening the stimulus bill was neither the first nor only matter to which Democrats turned their Cares Act attention . They thought the original sum proposed by the White House--$850 million -- was not nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protecting workers who were losing their livelihoods and providing funds to hospitals for needed equipment and protective gear . Moreover , they wanted to prevent companies receiving assistance from using federal dollars to buy back company stock or to pay multi-million dollar executive salaries . <p> The greeninitiatives Democrats in Congress talked about for inclusion in the Act were an extension of the solar and wind energy tax credits , turning the tax credits into direct payments , and making economic assistance to the airline industry contingent on its lowering its carbon emissions by 2050 . The proposals did not make it into the final bill ; however , we 've not heard the last of them . <p> Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics with the legislation . In their obloquies , Senate Majority Leader McConnell ( R-KY ) and President Trump tried to draw national attention away from the Democrat 's concern that funds would be given to corporations without any oversight and onto their efforts to defend against climate change . <p> The Democrats said ' We want green energy , let 's stop drilling oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Trump said . " Windmills all over the place and all sorts of credits for windmills -- they kill the birds and ruin the real estate . A lot of problems . <p> Democrats countered Republican claims they were holding up legislation that would aid the average Joe and Joann in their hometowns with charges of their own . Bernie Sanders 's campaign manager , Faiz Shakir , fairly expressed a common Democratic sentiment : <p> They utilize the fear tactic all the time . I 'm not worried about Democrats getting blamed because they did n't support a corporate bailout fast enough . I 'm worried about people getting behind solutions that are not adequate for solving the crisis . <p> The climate defense community was not alone in wanting the current stimulus package to aid various industries within the energy sector . The oil industry was hoping to secure $3 billion for the Department of Energy to cover the cost of purchasing 77 million barrels of oil to fill the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) . The funds were meant partially to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global pandemic and the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia . <p> The unprecedented clash between the two giant oil exporters -- and former OPEC+ allies -- threatens to push the price of a barrel below $20 . Moscow wo n't be the first to blink and seek a truce , according to people familiar with Putin 's positioni . Some analysts are predicting oil to drop into the teens before it 's all over . <p> Unwilling to miss a chance for a government bailout , the National Mining Association ( NMA ) askedTrump , House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to ensure that " coal companies have access to the necessary cash flow they need to continue operations . " The mine owners ' request was in the name of national security and based on their faulty assertion that coal reserves at power plants provide needed resilienceii . Coal is currently the most expensive source of power in the US . <p> Othercoal-related requests for stimulus assistance were made by a collaborative of climate protection and coal-area economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mountain Association for Community Economic Development , and Union of Concerned Scientists . In a letter to Congress , the signatories asked lawmakers to quickly advance equitable and comprehensive relief packages that support the people and the communities hit hardest by this coronavirous emergency . As non-partisan organizations focused on spurring economic development in places affected by the changing coal economy , we know these communities already struggle with deep job losses , declining government revenues and services , and ineffective health infrastructures . <p> All **26;184;TOOLONG proposals were left out of the Cares Act with the one exception of the $900 million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP ) that helps households heat and cool their homes . <p> Although a connection between the coronavirus and climate change may not jump immediately to mind , the pandemic offers some stark reminders of what we the people are doing to the environment in the US and elsewhere . The global lockdown has reduced air pollution as industries stand idle . One study estimates that two months of reduced pollution levels in China have saved 77,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canals had been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis , transports , and tourist boats . The chugging Vaporetto water buses now run on a reduced timetable . Even most of the gondolas are moored . The clarity of the water has improved so dramatically that cormorants have returned to dive for fish they can now see . <p> Almost as sad as the outbreak of the coronavirus itself , is it having taken a pandemic to give us a glimpse of what a sustainable environment might look like and what we 've been doing to it with our energy choices and unbridled tourism . I 'm not suggesting that the pandemic is somehow good for us or that the lives saved and those lost should be considered awash . Clear skies and canals , however , should give us pause . <p> Senate Majority Leader McConnell has said that the Cares Act isnot a stimulus at all.It is , rather , a safety net for the next few months . That 's a stunning statement to make about the largest stimulus legislation in American history . <p> Congressional leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that additional legislation will be needed to spur a stalled economy back to health . Before such a stimulus is enacted into law , questions concerning which industries to support and the nature of the assistance will need to be answered . The relative collegiality that allowed the current stimulus bill to be drafted , debated , and signed into law in weeks is unlikely to be continued in the pursuit of those answers . <p> The pandemic 's devastating impact on the nation 's financial markets is being looked at by some as a forced opportunity to reflect on and redirect the nation 's economy . The confluence of the coronavirus and the oil price war between Russia and China places the energy sector at the top of the examination list . <p> Before the virus-induced economic havoc of the pandemic , the fossil fuel industry was in a death spiral -- victims of market forces . Some sectors are spiraling faster than others , e.g. , shale oil and coal , but all are facing the global shift to cheaper and cleaner alternatives like solar and wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their corporate attention and resources to reducing their carbon footprints and finding alternatives if they are to survive . The dismal 2019 fourth-quarter reports of companies like Chevron and Exxon convinced investors from Wall Street to Main Street to divest their holdings . <p> Trump , along with many Republicans , justify their support of oil and coal under the claims of energy independence and national security . How secure is the nation when a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia so tanks the price of petroleum that even the oil majors have a tough time surviving under ordinary circumstances that are now being made extraordinarily worse by the pandemic ? All Trump has had to say about the spat is he 'll become involved at an appropriate time . What makes him believe his " good friends " Putin and Mohammed bin Salman will stop their war because he asks them to ? <p> To be truly healthy and independent , the US must move off a fossil fuel standard and onto clean energy .

In two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of reduced pollution . <p> Long after the coronavirus is conquered through science , lives will continue to be lost to pollution . We know how to cure the pollution problem today . <p> When Congressional attention turns from safety nets to stimulus , it will be a time for lawmakers to ask and answer the same hard question that triage doctors and nurses must answer every day because of the pandemic -- in the shadow of inadequate resources do we keep a patient , who stands little to no chance of survival , on life support ; or do we use finite resources on those with the greatest chance to live ? <p> Senator McConnell has called the proposed green amendments to the current stimulus package " unrelated . " Where the financial and physical health of a nation is involved , are there any amendments more related to the public 's safety and security than those whose purpose is to protect the environment ? <p> In an era of hyperpartisanship and legislative gridlock , the rapid passage of the Cares Act stands asa brilliant exception . Emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nearly as quickly or well over the past several years . <p> The battle between Republicans and Democrats on the need to combat climate change has not ended with the passage of the current safety net -- it has been temporarily postponed . <p> Americans have now seen , in the starkest of terms , what can happen when politicians dismiss sound scientific evidence as fake news . I wonder , then , if this is what Senator Kennedy was thinking when he said the country was founded by geniuses but is being run by idiots ? <p> iTrump has called the spat " devastating to Russia .

For one , closing colleges need to reach a memorandum of understanding with other schools that allows students to easily transfer . <p> MacMurray students can choose from 11 colleges and universities that made formal agreements to take them , even those with less than 30 hours of classes to complete , she says . Plus , MacMurray 's Division III coaches have worked to find athletes spots on sports teams at other schools . <p> But MacMurray faculty face a different reality .

That 's not a sustainable model for small private colleges like MacMurray , she says . <p> For other colleges in a similar position , Rodgers says do n't procrastinate . The world of higher education is disconnected from the workforce and how today 's students learn , she says -- and that needs to change . <p> " Higher education is not nimble . We are steeped in tradition , and we are not always able to move as quickly as we need to , " she says . " There needs to be a remake of higher education as a business model , in my opinion . " <p> Many other colleges in the U.S. also struggle with declining enrollments , rising competitive costs and an insufficient endowment on top of additional challenges caused by the coronavirus crisis . <p> Scott Carlson , senior writer for the Chronicle of Higher Education , predicts more closures in the future . Small colleges are under pressure from higher operating costs and increasing competition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of small private colleges were founded in small towns , he says , and now that 's a disadvantage because many students want to work in cities .

" And that spells disaster , I think , for the fall , particularly if these students ca n't come back to campus because of COVID-19 . " <p> Small private colleges often depend on tuition and room and board to stay afloat . Fees for room and board make up for some of the money colleges discount from students ' tuition , Carlson says . <p> A number of private colleges are asking the state to help them stay afloat during this crisis . States have an internal lobbying arm for small colleges , but this money is n't enough to carry a school facing serious financial trouble through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from states , Carlson says many of these institutions will also face financial issues further down the line . The economic devastation caused by the pandemic will lead states to cut back on funding , he predicts . <p> Funding cuts may not impact big schools like Pennsylvania State University , for example , but rather small public institutions like Mansfield University of Pennsylvania , he says . Small public colleges have also faced competition from bigger institutions in their states in recent years -- and Carlson says the impact of a school closing goes beyond a single campus . <p> " These small colleges are sort of the last economic engines of these places , so if the students do n't show up , the colleges are in trouble , " he says .

That is until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market seriously and make its presence felt . <p> As the trades over the past few weeks have shown , it is time the RBI took Thorat committee 's view seriously and made a serious effort to tame this opaque market . <p> In the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies , released along with the bi-monthly monetary policy statement today , the RBI allowed banks , which operate International Financial Services Centre Banking Units , or IFSC banking units , to participate in the offshore non-deliverable rupee derivative market , with effect from Jun 1 . <p> The statement first noted the rapid growth of the NDF markets in recent times , and also that Indian banks are not yet permitted to trade there , although " the benefits of their participation in the NDF market have been widely recognised " . <p> " ... the time is apposite to remove segmentation between the onshore and offshore markets and improve efficiency of price discovery , " RBI said . <p> It is important to note that this is a reform and developmental measure , which was the only such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory relaxations announced today , indicating that the RBI thought it crucial to move ahead on this issue , despite the market prioritising its relief measures . <p> On Monday , a day before the rupee fell to its record low of 76.24 a dollar , the rupee in the non-deliverable forwards market had weakened to 77.82 a dollar level . <p> At a time when trade volumes in currency market have dried up due to lower attendance by traders in banks ' dealing rooms , the depreciation in the rupee has been sharper than it would have been otherwise . <p> The rupee has lost 3.6% against the greenback this month so far , and 5.8% in the offshore market at the same time , a faster pace of depreciation in the non-deliverable forwards market . <p> The linkage between the dollar/rupee exchange rate in both the markets is so strong that the rupee has derived opening cues from the rates in the offshore market on multiple occasions , especially when market players have found themselves out of clear signals from global markets amid global uncertainties .

It may not be completely convertible currency , but it is a reasonably international currency . So there is a market , not necessarily only for speculation . There is a lot of hedging activity that takes place in the NDF market ... " Ashish Parthasarthy , head of treasury at HDFC Bank , said . <p> " There are differences in the prices of two markets .

The CFO <p> B. The CTO <p> C. COVID-19 <p> Sad but true , the coronavirus has forced millions of businesses around the world to discover very fast whether they can function with staff working from home . <p> This is not just a temporary problem , either . No one knows how long alert levels will last , and there is potential for further disruptions to business as we continue to navigate the coronavirus crisis . <p> It may not be feasible to simply move all your staff back to the office within a few weeks given social distancing requirements , and some people may continue to work from home for longer , or during enforced quarantine periods . <h> Knowing what needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require you to look deeply into your current business processes and technology . It may require changes to what is considered ' the new normal ' in your workplace and ways of operating . <p> But how do you do that ? <p> There are three steps when it comes to future-proofing your business for efficient long-term remote working . <p> 1 . Perform a gap analysis : assess what did and did n't work during lockdown or enforced remote working <p> 2 . Develop an adaptation plan : aim to fill any gaps you 've identified , and address any big problems that arose . <p> 3 . Prioritise general improvements across the rest of your technology landscape : here you can start to improve the remote-working experience for clients and employees alike . <p> When you go through this process , you should be able to gather some common pain-points , and identify what needs to be addressed . <h> Here are some common problems and possible solutions that we see when adopting remote working . <h> Breakdown of staff and workflow efficiencies <p> Things you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are off-site . <p> Some work activities may not be possible at home .

Quick fix ' workarounds ' set up before the level 4 lockdown may have got your team online ... but is your team as productive as they were before ? <p> To improve efficiencies and restore workflows you often need to find new ways of doing tasks : for example , digitising activities normally done on paper , implementing e-signatures , or finding a different tool to track employee output . <h> Inability to effectively communicate <p> If staff are used to working in the office with an internal phone system , or desks near to one another , moving to remote working can mean all these communication processes ( between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some companies get stuck using multiple communication systems . For example , they may use cell phone calls for some clients , calls to the main offline line for others , and calls to DDIs for the remainder . This is scattered and inefficient . <p> The worst case scenario is when clients or customers are unable to reach staff through the main office line and resort to using mobile phone calls . If a client phone call is sent to a personal mobile voicemail , the company appears less professional . Mobile phone calls also are not easily transferred between team members . <p> The best solution for these communication and presence issues related to remote working is a unified communications platform . A unified communication platform enables all communication between clients/customers and staff to go through a centralised platform -- including voice calls , chat , conferences and screen sharing to enable integration with outlook calendar meetings and your CRM .

This BYOD policy should cover : <p> * The tools or applications that employees may access on their personal devices <p> * The employer 's rights in respect of access to data contained on personal devices <p> * Resetting home router passwords ( because these are usually insecure ) <p> * How the various risks associated with the use of personal devices are shared and mitigated . <p> There are still extra security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too -- and remote working is always less secure than working within a more secure network as you would in the office . <p> Unsuitable infrastructure for remote work <p> A general reliance on on-site infrastructure can present significant challenges when working remotely . If this is the case for your business , you may need to change your IT infrastructure . <p> For example , you may have a set-up where : <p> * Your CRM ( customer relationship management ) systems are available only from in the office <p> * You ca n't access files remotely , as all are stored on desktops and local hard drives <p> There are several cloud-based storage solutions that enable easy storage in the cloud , including Dropbox , OneDrive , or Google Drive . If you 're already using Office 365 or Microsoft 365 , you may actually be paying for a license that includes a suitable product ! <p> It is key to review all the functionalities of your current subscriptions to see whether there is a viable solution in there to solve your infrastructure issues . <h> Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up perfectly , if your home/remote work network is not , there will be speed and staff productivity issues . Poor network infrastructure may even mean staff are unable to access company tools and data . You may need to upgrade your staff to ultra-fast broadband . <p> Another issue is that using a VPN connection from home to tap into the work server ( a common remote-work solution ) can give you a slow experience , whether or not you have ultra-fast broadband ! <p> If you have ultra-fast broadband installed but still suffer from slow internet speeds , you may require a signal boost , which can be achieved with an enterprise-quality wireless access point or physical cabling improvements . <p> Stay connectedas a team <p> Staying connected with staff is essential .

We expect the retail segment 's same-store sales growth to pick up from 2HFY21 once the curfew imposed at end-March 2020 is relaxed to a larger extent . The majority of RICH 's supermarkets , which are in the Western Province , were closed till 11 May due to the curfew . RICH conducted its sales through online , and call and order channels in the Western Province but sales were around 30% of normal levels . Stores have been allowed to reopen , but footfall may not normalise immediately due to continued social distancing requirements . <p> We expect consumer spending patterns on essential items such as food and beverage , grocery items and personal and homecare to regularise starting 2HFY20 resulting in a gradual normalisation of foot fall and basket sizes . <p> However the supermarket chain will continue to see weakness in certain product categories such as furniture and electronics as consumers defer such purchases . <p> Retail revenues should also benefit from new store openings in 2020 which will start contributing meaningfully from 2HFY21 . Recovery in Plantation : We expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover in FY21 , benefitting from better volumes across all crops and pricing improvements in tea and palm oil . Demand for tea has been rising in the past few months amid consumer preference for hot beverages since the pandemic and supply disruptions in India . <p> This , together with local currency depreciation , has led to a material price increase at the Colombo tea auctions . RICH 's tea volume should also improve in FY21 due to the resumption of the use of pesticides and weedicides , which were banned for a few years . Volatility in global demand and prices remains a significant risk to our forecast for the sector . <p> RICH 's palm-oil volume should benefit in the medium term from an increasing number of trees entering the higher yielding age bracket . The local palm-oil sector benefits from tariffs on imports and local palm-oil prices are rising due to increased import tariffs and the weakening local exchange rate , which offsets our expectations of a decline in global palm-oil prices . We expect the plantation sector to contribute around LKR600 million in EBITDA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Exports : RICH 's export segment ( 20% of group EBIT ) will face a significant revenue impact from the COVID-19 . In FY20 , the segment derived a majority of revenue from North America and Europe , which are severely affected by the pandemic . <p> Consequently , we expect demand for RICH 's premium-priced latex mattresses to remain weak for a prolonged period . RICH is planning to shift some of its sales to the fast-growing Chinese market , but we expect demand to remain sluggish even in China despite early signs of economic recovery . The export segment also derives modest revenue from rubber rings used in the food business , and we expect this revenue to be resilient during the downturn . <p> Turnaround in Tyre Sales : RICH 's retreading business 's market position has improved further due to the exit of its main competitor last year . The company has been able to gain around 10% of market share due to the exit and currently holds around 60% of the share as the rest of the competition is highly fragmented . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for the next three-six months in an effort to support its external finances . This should drive demand for retreading in the short-to-medium term . Customers in the transport and logistics sectors that account for the majority of RICH 's retreading sales should continue to spend on fleet maintenance to support their livelihoods . <p> However , RICH was able to move to a leaner cost structure in FY20 by adopting cost effective sourcing strategies and rationalising some of its fixed costs , which should help defend margins in a downturn . Its export , plastic and tyre segments have variable cost structures and around 30% of fixed costs such as electricity can also be contained when plant-utilisation levels are low . The company is also <p> introducing cost-cutting measures at the group level , including pay cuts , which we estimate will amount to around 1% of FY21 revenue . <p> Leverage Increase Manageable : We forecast RICH 's leverage , defined as net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR ( excluding its finance subsidiary ) , will rise to 3.0x in FY21 amid the weak operating environment . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes steps to preserve cash .

We expect net leverage to fall to around 2.7x after FY21 on stronger cash flow generation across all segments . Our forecasts factor in capital injections into RICH 's finance subsidiary in FY21 and FY22 to meet its regulatory capital requirements . <p> DERIVATION SUMMARY <p> RICH is a diversified conglomerate with exposure to both defensive sectors and growth markets . The company is rated two notches below domestic healthcare and consumer company Hemas Holdings PLC ( AA-(lka)/Stable ) , and Lion Brewery ( Ceylon ) PLC ( AA-(lka)/Stable ) , the country 's leading brewer , to reflect RICH 's higher exposure to cyclical end-markets and the capital infusions required at its weak finance subsidiary , which increase its business risks . <p> Sunshine Holdings PLC ( A-(lka)/Stable ) , another domestic conglomerate , is rated one notch below RICH to reflect its smaller operating scale due to competing in somewhat niche markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pharmaceuticals , which more than offset Sunshine 's lower leverage . <p> KEY ASSUMPTIONS <p> Revenue decline of 17% in FY21 , driven by a 50% decline in exports , 30% in plastics and 17% in supermarkets , mitigated by a 10% increase in plantations .

@@31846941 <h> Cooking Your Way Through the Pandemic <p> I write this from my studio at the back of our garden in London , to which I have retreated for a few moments to be alone , as " alone " is not easily experienced these days . My wife , Felicity , and I have been sequestered here with our two small children , a boy 5 , a girl 2 ; my three older children ( whom I had with my late wife , Kate ) , a girl 18 , boy/girl twins 20 ; and a girlfriend of theirs from university , who was unable to get to her parents overseas . <p> Cramming all these people with differing personalities , ages , needs , wants , etc. in a house for six weeks creates for an interesting dynamic . For the most part , things have been going very well , meaning no one has murdered anyone yet , although I am sure one of them is plotting my demise as I type this . <p> At first , I had grand plans for how we might pass the time in convivial and entertaining ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly meal , followed by movies , games , or Bordeaux-fueled charades by the fire . Things did n't quite work out that way . Instead , here 's what our typical day looks like . <h> 7 a.m . GMT <p> Within moments of Felicity and I awakening , our 5-year-old is in our room . It 's not clear how he knows we 're awake . For all we know , he has a monitor like the one we use to listen to his 2-year-old sister . He waltzes over to my wife 's side of the bed , completely ignoring me as usual , and begins to chat with her about nothing and everything . ( His usual topic is dragons , as he is obsessed with the book series How to Train Your Dragon and its various cinematic spin-offs . ) Felicity and I head to the bathroom , and he follows and perches himself on the bidet to regale us with plot points from the novels and observations about the seemingly endless variety of dragons and their specific attributes . He will carry on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we head to his sister 's room , where she has been " singing " in her crib and perusing the shredded remains of her extensive Peppa Pig book collection . When she sees us enter , she inevitably covers her face with a book and pretends to be asleep . She thinks this is funny . She is right . I change her nappy and she kicks me in the groin a few times for my trouble . <p> We all head downstairs for breakfast . For me , this consists of a double espresso , orange juice , and a bowl of cereal with a banana and almond milk . I also choke down a handful of vitamins , including D3 , K2 , C , B12 , curcumin powder , and joint supplements so my knees do n't crack like a melting glacier every time I bend down to pick up a rogue Lego . Felicity has her tea and the children have toast , cereal , fruit , the occasional egg , or whatever else their little hearts desire . Most of their food ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep clean of the day . <h> 8 a.m . <p> I tidy up their mess , empty the dishwashers ( yes , we have two ) , scour the counters , wipe down the cabinets and their handles , and organize the contents of the fridge , discarding anything past its due date . I also sweep the floor , but after summoning considerable willpower decide to delay the mopping for after lunch . <p> As you might glean , I am a very tidy person . I actually like to clean , as I find it soothing . But I have gone a bit above and beyond during lockdown . The other day , it occurred to me that I might be able to strap a vacuum to my back like a leaf blower so that it could be with me at all times . <h> 8:45 a.m . <p> Felicity and I do an online workout with a friend of ours who is a Pilates teacher . The night before , we asked one of the older children to come down this morning and babysit . Seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face still swollen from sleep , and grunts a " Good morning " as we flee to the living room for a fitness-filled escape from reality . During this time , I think about what we might cook that evening for eight people yet again . <h> 9:45 a.m . <p> When the session ends , Felicity and I go over what food items need to be restocked . With four people ages 18 to 20 , the amount of food , beer , and wine consumed is staggering . If there is a shortage of avocados at the local stores , it 's because we 've eaten them all . If there is no Kerrygold butter left in the United Kingdom , it 's because it 's either in our freezer or we ate it . All of it . Just fucking ate it . Probably without even spreading it on anything . I saw a neighbor hungrily eyeing our cat yesterday and it occurred to me that the woman probably had n't eaten meat in a week , because my gluttonous family had devoured all of the fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork , rabbit , and game in Southwest London . Still gasping for breath from an unnecessarily grueling workout , I rummage through the fridge . <p> Given our short supplies , I decide to make something simple tonight : pasta alla Norma and saut ? ed lamb chops . I reckon that these two dishes should satisfy everyone 's palate and nutritional needs . However , I know that my middle daughter will eat only the pasta dish , as she is now a vegetarian . What timing . <p> In a very large frying pan , fry the garlic in some of the oil for about two minutes . Add the eggplant and cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes , until it is slightly golden . Salt to taste . When the eggplant is cooked , add the marinara sauce and cook together for about five minutes . Drain the pasta , reserving ? cup of the water . Stir the reserved pasta water into the pan mixture and sprinkle with the basil . Remove four cups of the sauce and put it into a serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the sauce and gently stir it all together . Serve and sprinkle with grated ricotta salata or pecorino. <h> 10:30 a.m . <p> After doing some homeschooling with the 5-year-old , Felicity heads upstairs to shower and begin her remote workday from our bedroom . She is a literary agent and carries out her endless meetings via Zoom . With the exception of finishing voice-over work from my studio for a CNN series I recently completed , I have very little to do these days , as film and TV production have shut down . As far as I know , this has never happened since somebody first called " Action ! " more than 100 years ago . <p> So I do the laundry and play with the kids -- often made-up games such as Mean King , in which I affect a very posh British accent and they come to me to " pay their taxes " and then " steal " them back when I " take a nap .

I try to drag the game out for as long as possible so I do n't have to get up , but the 2-year-old is beginning to reek and I realize that I have been neglectful in my nappy-changing duties . <p> When this wrestling match has ended and she has accused everyone in the house ( besides herself ) of pooping , I change them both out of their pajamas and into the outfit of the day . Although the 5-year-old can dress himself , today he insists that he is incapable of doing so . I therefore talk him through each stage while the 2-year-old hurtles herself through the room , screaming with laughter and jeering at me . I finally catch her , body-slam her to the sofa , and stuff her into her first of many outfits of the day , like sausage meat into a casing . My glasses are nowhere to be found , and therefore I ca n't see well enough to work the minuscule fucking buttons on children 's clothing , so I leave part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't . But I do and it plagues me for the rest of the day. ) <h> 11 a.m . <p> Once the children are dressed , I usher them into the garden , where they bounce on the trampoline and beg me to allow them to play with the hose . Sometimes I will bounce or " wrestle " with them for a bit , and this makes them very happy . It has the same effect on me as well . After a while , I finally relent and allow them some water play , with a hose , buckets , and a miniature plastic kitchen set . <p> With the kids sufficiently distracted , I head inside and begin cooking , keeping an eye on them from the kitchen window . I first decide to make chicken stock with leftover carcasses . <p> SIMPLE CHICKEN STOCK <p> 1 chicken carcass and a whole chicken without breast meat , or two of each <p> 10 mixed peppercorns <p> 1 yellow onion -- cut in half , skin on <p> 1 red onion -- cut in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on <p> 2 celery stalks -- quartered <p> 2 carrots -- quartered <p> A handful of parsley <p> 2 bay leaves <p> A fair amount of salt <p> 1 sprig of rosemary <p> 2 sprigs of thyme <p> Break down the chicken , place in a stockpot , and cover with water . Bring to a boil and skim off the scum that rises to the top . Add the other ingredients and cook slightly covered for as long as you want , at least two hours . Strain through a sieve into some sort of vessel and refrigerate or put into freezer bags and freeze . <h> 12:15 p.m . <p> The older generation of children awakens . They enter the kitchen and make quick work of an entire loaf of bread , two pints of cherry tomatoes , four avocados , six eggs , two pints of blueberries , four bananas , 20 rashers of bacon , one liter of almond milk , six Nespresso pods , and a liter of orange juice before retreating to the TV room or their bedrooms , where they tell me they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do n't . Felicity comes down and serves the little ones lunch after I have changed their waterlogged clothes . I am off to clean a bathroom or two , do some more laundry , or vacuum something that I just vacuumed three hours before . <h> 1:45 p.m . <p> Felicity puts the 2-year-old down for her nap , the 5-year-old listens to his audiobook , and I make marinara and prep the eggplant for the pasta alla Norma. <h> 3 p.m . <p> When all is prepped and the kitchen is cleaned once again , it is my intention to write something , read , or catch up on emails . Instead I pick up the New York Times crossword puzzle to clear my head , and promptly fall asleep . <h> 3:30 p.m . <p> I awaken with spittle on my chin and too few clues answered . Glancing at my watch , I rush upstairs to awaken the 2-year-old from her nap . When I arrive , Felicity is already changing her while doing a conference call . I know she wants to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person than that . I take the child , finish the diapering , redress her , and head downstairs . I give both children a snack and we play together in the garden . We bounce on the trampoline , do chalk drawings on the patio , look for slugs , and maybe do some drawing or painting . It is at once lovely and exhausting . We are laughing one moment and the next someone is weeping and I am adjudicating , saying things such as : <p> " Let her have it for a few minutes and then you can have it . " <p> " What 's a few ? " <p> " A few is three . " <p> " Three minutes ? " <p> " Yes , three minutes . And then you can have it . " <p> " Will you time it ? " <p> " Yes , I will time it . " <p> I do indeed " time it , " but the 2-year-old screams when whatever object they both covet gets taken from her . Play begins anew but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I look at my watch and will it to be 5 p.m .

Pour into a coupe . Garnish with half of an orange slice . Drink . <h> 5 p.m . <p> The older children have now come downstairs to eat an entire fucking meal before dinner . Thankfully , as penance , two of them take the little ones up for their bath . Felicity enters the kitchen and begs for a Negroni . I gladly make her one , as I hate to drink alone , although I have been known to make near-daily exceptions . And anyway , one is never really drinking alone . Someone else is drinking somewhere . We prepare the children 's dinner : lamb chops , rice , and string beans . I switch to white wine and thank Christ it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADULTS <p> 10 to 12 lamb chops , salted an hour before using <p> 3 cloves of garlic -- halved <p> A bit of fresh rosemary <p> A bit of fresh thyme <p> A splash of white wine <p> A glug of EVOO <p> In a cast-iron pan , splash a tiny bit of the oil and add the garlic . Cook at a low heat for about three minutes . Remove the garlic and set aside . Turn the heat up to medium-high and sear the lamb chops for about two to three minutes on each side , until they are browned . You may do this in two batches . Remove the lamb chops from the pan and set them aside on a platter . Add a splash of white wine to the pan , and perhaps a little water , and deglaze . Return the garlic to the pan along with the herbs . Cook for maybe a minute . Pour over the lamb chops and tent with foil for five minutes . <h> 6 p.m . <p> The little ones eat their meal , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spewing old chestnuts such as : <p> " There will be no dessert for you , young man .

" <p> After their meal is eaten , sort of , the little ones are allowed to watch a bit of television . Dragons for him , Peppa Pig for her . ( There is no question that my wife and I , along with many parents , wish the creators of that irritating animated swine a slow death , but they are so rich , they have probably purchased immortality . And yet at the same time , said pig allows us respite for half an hour or so every day .

This is the last time . " <p> And it is . Until tomorrow . <h> 7:45 p.m . <p> Felicity and I cook dinner for ourselves and the four other human locusts , and eat standing around the kitchen island because we ca n't be bothered to set the table anymore . We eat , drink wine , and comment on the food , but this past week we barely spoke with one another . This makes me sad , as I know it 's because we are all lost in our own anxieties . I am sure that the 20-year-olds are thinking about whether their year abroad will happen at all ; my 18-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide who gets accepted and who does n't without anyone having taken exams .

I wonder if my very social parents are really practicing social distancing , what jobs will be available when this is over , and know already that I most likely will have to be away for a while working on one of them to fill the coffers . <p> But no matter how frustrated we all are with the situation , I know we ca n't help but think how lucky we are to have one another , a roof over our heads , food in our bellies , and no symptoms of illness . Only a couple of miles away in any direction there are hospitals chock-full of ill and dying patients who are being attended to by overworked and overwhelmed National Health Service doctors , nurses , and support staff . Other than sending checks and raising money for charities and the NHS by making videos at home , we are helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat in silence , we are all hoping this will end soon without too much more suffering , that our leaders will get at least one thing right along the way , and that the next time we are all sequestered together it is by choice . <h> 9:15 p.m . <p> The kitchen has been cleaned by group effort and we head our separate ways : the kids to the TV room , my wife and I to the sitting room to read .

" I would say our relationship and our interaction ( with the U.S. ) is going well -- it 's almost daily at all levels of government -- to make sure that we protect the safety of all Canadians .

" We 're taking COVID-19 incredibly seriously , and our teams , our public-health agencies , are actively working as we sit here and also trying to reform the entire health-care system .

Dar made the statement after foreign news outfits reported that Vietnam has temporarily suspended new rice export contracts until March 28 pending analysis of its staple inventory . <p> AFP personnel help in repacking rice to be distributed to local government units at a Department of Social and Welfare Development warehouse in Pasay City . <p> " For us it is a concern .

The country annually imports about 8 percent to 10 percent of its local demand to plug the shortfall in its domestic output . <p> The agriculture chief said , " Reconsidering early planting in most areas , including Regions 2 and 3 , to boost production during the third quarter , " which is the country 's lean season or when harvest is minimal . <p> Dar reiterated that they have already proposed a P32-billion food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( EDC ) to ensure sufficiency of local food supply even beyond the month-long enhanced community quarantine ( ECQ ) . <p> Under its proposed Alpas Covid 19 program , or Ahon Lahat , Pagkaing Sapat Kontra sa Covid-19 , the DA will roll out interventions to improve local farm output , which includes an P8.5-billion rice resiliency project to boost staple output in areas not supported by the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund ( RCEF ) . <h> Importation continues <p> Dar disclosed that rice importation has not been halted despite the ongoing harvest and added that they are closely monitoring arrivals to analyze the country 's supply sufficiency level . <p> He said the country has other sources for imported rice , like Myanmar , Thailand , India and Pakistan , should Vietnam push through with banning its exports to ensure its domestic supply of the staple amid the Covid-19 pandemic . <h> Vietnam 's suspension <p> Vietnam has temporarily suspended signing new export contracts until March 28 after Prime Minister Nguyen Phuc ordered the ministries of trade and agriculture to assess the country 's domestic rice supplies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development was confirmed to the BusinessMirror by a rice trader who has supply deals with Vietnamese exporters . <p> The rice importer said the Vietnam government has already circulated a document to all exporters that shipments would be temporarily halted pending the March 28 analysis of the country 's staple supply . <p> " We are closely watching how this develops . But we are not worried since it is a natural reaction from a government to protect their food security during these times , " the importer said via phone call . <p> The rice importer said he does not see the ban pushing through beyond March 28 , since Vietnam would be unable to consume all the stocks that would be reverted to domestic supplies . <p> Besides , banning the exports would incur huge losses for traders and exporters since the volumes have been contracted and positioned to be export-bound , the importer added . <p> " We have to remember that majority of exporters in Vietnam are half-owned by state-owned trading companies . They have to do this to show the public that they are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation will escalate , " the importer said . <p> " If they have to stop exports , I do n't think Vietnam can consume whole the production . For 2020 , their production curve is based on the demand both locally and internationally . So if they have to drop the exports segment , they will have problems in oversupply and prices will go down , " the importer added . <p> The government had earlier approved the importation of over 1.4 MMT of rice after it issued over 1,800 sanitary and phytosanitary import clearances ( SPS-ICs ) to about 145 grain retailers , traders , importers and farmers ' organizations . <p> Latest Bureau of Plant Industry ( BPI ) data showed that as of February 29 , it has issued 1,877 SPS-ICs to eligible rice importers , covering the importation of 1.472 MMT . <h> Too early to tell <p> The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) projected that Vietnam 's rice production this year would increase by 1.91 percent to 28.3 MMT from 27.767 MMT last year . <p> Of its total output , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be sold in Vietnam 's domestic market , USDA 's monthly forecast report showed . <p> However , Monetary Board member V.

CNN report says the hospital staff in China has started serving tea to the patients 3 times a day , And the effect is finally in Wuhan " the centre of this Pandemic " where the effect of COVID-19 has been contained and community transmission has almost stopped.However , there is no scientific verification of the magic remedy so far except for the scientists becoming busy to research how China was able to stop so fast the third stage of the community spread of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no new reported cases in Hubei , the province where the virus was first identified , at all on Wednesday.The milestone will likely be held up as proof of the ongoing success of China 's sweeping , top-down efforts to control the virus , despite persistent allegations that local officials mishandled the initial outbreak . Just last month , mainland China was reporting thousands of new cases every day , and was considered the most high-risk infection area in the world.In the weeks following the early spread of the virus , the Chinese government enacted draconian quarantine measures and strict travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens . In some hard-hit cities , residents have been unable to leave their apartments for more than a month , while transport between major population hubs has been limited or halted altogether.The unprecedented nature of the measures has exacted a steep toll , however , both on the many millions of ordinary Chinese forced to endure life under lockdown and the country 's economy , which has seen a steep decline in recent weeks .

According to the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research , there is no evidence or research to claim that these bat coronaviruses can cause disease in humans , said Dr Pragya D Yadav , Scientist at the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) , Pune and also the first author of study . Twenty-five bats of Rousettus and Pteropus species from Kerala , Himachal Pradesh , Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were found positive for BtCoV in Kerala , Himachal Pradesh , Puducherry and Tamil Nadu . " These bat coronaviruses have no relation with SARS-CoV2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic , " Yadav @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive for Nipah virus in 2018 and 2019 in Kerala . " Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses , of which some are potential human pathogens . In India , an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past . It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) also has its association with bats , " the objective of the study titled ' Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus and Rousettus species of bats from different states of India ' stated . " In the present scenario of changing demography and ecological manipulations , it is challenging to have checks on the encounters of bats with other animals and humans , " the study stated , highlighting that the need for active and continuous surveillance remains crucial for outbreak alerts for bat-associated viral agents with epidemic potential , which would be helpful in timely interventions .

It is still not understood as to why only certain CoVs can infect people , " the study said . The scientists stressed on the need of proactive surveillance of zoonotic infections in bats . The detection and identification of such viruses from bats also recommends cross-sectional antibody surveys ( human and domestic animals ) in localities where the viruses have been detected . Similarly , if the epidemiological situation demands , evidence-based surveillance should also be conducted , the study said while emphasing on the need of developing strong mechanisms for working jointly with various stakeholders such as wildlife , poultry , animal husbandry and human health departments . " In conclusion , our study showed detection of bat CoVs in two species of Indian bats . Continuous active surveillance is required to identify the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential , " Dr Yadav said .

@@31859241 <p> More than 80 per cent of India 's farmers are small and marginal farmers , who own less than 5 acres of land . Individually , because of the size of the landholding , they are underrepresented and do n't have access to a host of services such as access to affordable credit and affordable warehousing , which farmers with larger farms do . Amidst the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown , fear of falling prices of food grains , drop in exports and lower demand have created a distress situation across communities of these farmers . On the other hand , marginal farmers who are getting ready for the upcoming sowing season are in urgent need of credit for inputs and for the sustenance of their own families . <p> Rang De and NDTV have come together and initiated a campaign #RangDeIndia to highlight the impending crisis faced by India 's farmers . It is also a clarion call to ordinary citizens of India to join hands in support of these small and marginal farmers . By providing interest-free loans to farmers in distress situation , the campaign aims to ensure that they are able to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis , while at the same time carry on with their farming . <p> As a part of the campaign , a 2-hour special telethon was also organised to raise funds that will help reach out to these vulnerable people during this tough time of the pandemic . Experts , social workers and celebrities came together to discuss the impact of coronavirus on our farmers , who ensure that we continue to have food on our table , and how everyone can come together and make sure that the farmer 's family does not go hungry . <p> Joining the telethon with NDTV 's Dr Prannoy Roy , Dr GV Ramanjaneyulu , Founder &amp; Executive Director at the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture highlighted how the beginning of the lockdown affected the harvest season for the farmers and the challenges faced by them , he said , <p> Farmers are in deep crisis . We see daily that a number of migrants are on the road who are part of the rural economy . About 54.6 per cent of the population is dependent on agriculture and 87 per cent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The income of an average farmer is 8,931 per month . The lockdown has affected this income by about 60 per cent . <p> Further talking about the crisis that the farmers are facing , Dr GV Ramanjaneyulu added , <p> Some farmers were unable to sell their produce as transport was affected in the lockdown due to coronavirus . Particularly fresh vegetables and fruit sector have been affected significantly in this time . Many farmers are landless and they take land on lease for which they pay high interests . <p> Dr. Nachiket Mor , PhD , Visiting Scientist , The Banyan Academy of Leadership in Mental Health stressed on the fact that our farmers are in distress , given the situation today . Explaining the term ' peer to peer lending ' which is a relatively a new concept in India , Dr. Nachiket Mor said , <p> What is happening with your money and how is the money being spent is an important component of peer to peer lending . In a regular lending context , you are looking at the lowest risk borrowing .

It will bring the habit of giving . It involves civil society in a very easy way . I just have to write a cheque to Rang de or transfer money . It is easy to help those who feed us . It is a brilliant way of connecting and getting more and more people involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We are buying rations directly from farmers , this is the direct relief as they are getting the money directly which is very essential at this point of time as they are not able to sell their produce because of the lockdown . <p> I was n't really aware earlier but after lockdown when I started cooking myself , I started wondering where are these people who are growing vegetables and food grains . I realised how much far we are from our farmers . I personally do n't know any farmers . But initiatives like Rang De helps us to know them personally . <p> Highlighting how everyone can help support the one who provides us with food - our farmers , Adil Hussain , Actor added , <p> I know how difficult it is to produce something from the soil . What has distressed me the most is the distress faced by the farmers , farmers suicide and how we have accepted this . When I came to know about Rang de India , I got to know how one can help the farmers as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It is a sacred responsibility . <p> Talking about the Rang De India model and how it plans to reach out to the farmers , Ram NK , Co-Founder &amp; MD , Rang De said , <p> In 2006 , we wanted to come back to India and do something for society . We noticed that the credit was very very expensive and we narrowed down to building a platform that can ease borrowing for the needy . At Rang De , we partner with an organisation who help us reach the farmers and we transfer the money int he bank accounts of the farmers . You can also see how your money is being spent and who is being helped in a very transparent way . <p> It is extremely important that we take time out from our lives to help those in need , be it the migrant workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also joined the telethon and stressed how we as a community should come together and ensure that our farmers are able to take care of themselves and their families in this tough time , he said , <p> Seasonal problem is very high for farmers , like in my village itself , there are farmers who have faced high rainfall because of which wheat got rotten in the farm itself . It is very important for all of us who can help support these vulnerable people . <p> Abhijit Banerjee , Nobel Laureate in Economics stressed on the fact that the farmers need a good support system and added , <p> As far as relief measures are concerned , I think the government should have gone further because a lot of people who rely on agriculture are not recognised as farmers . So identifying only farmers will not be enough . Middle-class rural India has fallen into poverty . If you try to target you will miss the most affected . We have a massive number of migrants and they need social support . It is not their fault that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it becomes a positive turning point and things improve from here . <h> Investments Raised So Far <h> How It Works ? <p> Invest as little as Rs.100 on rangde.in/ndtv <p> We will disburse the amount into the farmer 's bank account <p> You get notified as soon as the investment is made <p> Please note that 100% of your social investment is disbursed to the farmers directly .

@@84582141 <p> The numbers associated with COVID-19 , its infectivity , hospital admissions , deaths , are all being studied like tea leaves for any pattern or trend . And the numbers vary quite a bit . Those variations are often ascribed to the veracity of the source or some underlying agenda of hope or fearmongering , and occasionally to a mathematical error . <p> But in most instances , the problem is really two old cognitive difficulties , numbers appear far more precise and concrete than they actually are and a number by itself has little meaning , it requires the context , often another number -- ratios . <p> Rate of Infection <p> R0 is a means of quantifying how infectious the virus is , and you have all seen the numbers suggesting that it is worse than seasonal flu and not as bad as measles . Knowing the rate of infection is a way to get a handle on how quickly COVID-19 has spread , and that often is described as the rate of infection for a given population . The explicit ratio is the number of infected individuals divided by the size of the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , essential set of numbers -- how many people are being tested and the incidence of positive findings . <p> A study of the available data from New York City 1 broken out by zip code is instructive . Recently , the press has made quite a point of discussing the socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 's victims , largely the same groups that suffer from inadequate access to medical care , lower incomes , and additional co-morbidities . And looking at the map of the five boroughs confirms those findings . Those purple areas include the Bronx , parts of Queens , Brooklyn , and Staten Island . But are those numbers accurate ? <p> The researcher made use of COVID-19 testing information , available by zip code , and integrated it with census data , describing the general characteristics of the zip code , income , housing , minority representation . That data does n't tell a different story , but it shows that the number of infected individuals may be significantly underestimated . <p> Graph A shows that the number of tests performed does not vary with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and state government is testing without racial bias . <p> Graph B shows that predilection of COVID-19 for minority communities , the greater the percentage , the higher the rate of positive tests . <p> Those two trends come together in Graph C , the incidence or number of infected individuals . You can see that the equality of testing has inadvertently lowered the impact of those positive tests . What is politically correct is not appropriate for public health measurements . More testing needs to be done in the hotspot zip codes , and less in the parts of New York where we can see the incidence is less . <p> Before some jump to attribute this to politics , remember that this is , in part , a chicken and egg problem , you ca n't focus testing until you have a better idea where to focus . But intent aside , you can begin to see why infectivity rates can vary so much . The amount of testing , the true incidence in the population , and the population 's size are aggregated within that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , like population density , age , and co-morbidities . For as much as the number seems concrete , it is built upon many forces pulling in different directions . <p> COVID-19 Deaths <p> Well , we can understand how infectivity may be challenging to quantify , but surely death is easier -- you are either alive or dead , a binary option . The difficulty in quantifying death begins the moment after all vital signs go to zero . Because death can be the result of a criminal act , it comes with regulations , the most important being that a physician must both certify and identify the reasons for death . <p> " A cause of death is the morbid condition or disease process , abnormality , injury , or poisoning leading directly or indirectly to death . The underlying cause of death is the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly or indirectly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury . A death often results from the combined effect of two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently of each other or they may be causally related to each other , that is , one cause may lead to another which in turn leads to a third cause , etc . <p> ... He is requested to report in Part I on line ( a ) the immediate cause of death and the antecedent conditions on lines ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) which gave rise to the cause reported on line ( a ) , the underlying cause being stated lowest in the sequence of events . However , no entry is necessary on I(b) , I(c) or I(d) if the immediate cause of death stated on I(a) describes completely the sequence of events . " <p> In the case of COVID-19 , a certificate might state that the immediate cause was viral pneumonia due to Coronavirus , along with antecedent conditions , co-morbidities , like hypertension and coronary artery disease . There is a 216-page manual 2 , that determines which among those immediate and antecedent causes is finally reported as the " cause of death . " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals , the duty to certify often falls to the first-year resident , who knows the least about any given patient . In community hospitals , it falls to the attending physician , and for deaths at home , to the patient 's primary care physician ; but while they know the patient 's history better , it would be a rare case when they were specifically trained in completing a death certificate . And I seriously doubt that any physician , other than a pathologist who studies dead patients , has even a nodding acquaintance with that 216-page manual . <p> To further simplify the attribution of death in the time of pandemic , Italy 's overwhelmed health system decided that any deaths in the hospital were attributed to COVID-19 . That , of course , increases the false-positive reports , increasing the deaths . It is balanced to some unknown degree by the physicians certifying deaths at home as not being due to COVID-19 , the false negatives . This week , as reported by the New York Post , our federal government has opted for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in Italy , it will mean higher death rates . <p> If you look at the current CDC data , you will find that a COVID-19 death does not require laboratory evidence , it is sufficient that " the certifier suspects COVID-19 or determines it was likely . " Another important limitation noted is this provisional information is incomplete , and " the level of completeness varies by jurisdiction , week , decedent 's age , and cause of death . ... It is important to note that the true levels of completeness are unknown , and the estimates provided here are only a proxy . " It has taken , in the past , up to 2 months to gather and verify 72% of pneumonia deaths . <p> Again , before jumping to identify a political intent to these changes , it is perhaps best to recognize how overwhelmed is the health system 's information technology . It was probably better prepared to deal with a computer virus than an actual one . But what is one bureaucrat 's efficiency in making all deaths due to COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tease out how the virus behaves . This was not a step towards transparency in data <p> In 1989 , the American Council on Science and Health released a documentary called Big Fears Little Risks , which was narrated by the great Walter Cronkite . The documentary focused on how exaggerated fears about " chemicals " made people afraid of their food . <p> Thirty years later , ACSH has produced an updated version of Big Fears Little Risks , focusing on issues such as vaccines , GMOs , pesticides , and nuclear power .

Please begin . <p> Thank you , and good evening . On the call today , we have Ceridian 's CEO , David Ossip ; and CFO , Arthur Gitajn . <p> Today , we are going to modify the format of our call from what we have previously done . As you likely saw , we posted a stockholder letter , along with our press release and 10-Q . The stockholder letter has all of the key highlights we would have previously provided in our prepared remarks on our quarterly earnings call . We will not read the stockholder letter on this call .

Good evening , everyone , and thank you for joining our earnings call . I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during this time of uncertainty . <p> Before we go to Q&amp;A , I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter . First , we had a strong quarter . Dayforce revenue , excluding float and on a constant currency basis , grew by 31.9% as compared to 25.3% in the same period last year . Cloud recurring services gross margin increased by 2.5% to 72.6% and in Cloud professional services and other , gross margin improved by 10.8% to negative 3.4% . Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 40 basis points year-over-year to 24.8% . <p> Second , Dayforce continues to see strong demand . We have moved to virtual summits and more digital marketing activities , and pipeline has grown . Based on what we 've seen , our virtual marketing methods have expanded our ability to reach potential customers . <p> Third , we are continuing to sell Dayforce in this economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of wins during the third quarter as well as the momentum we continue to see in April . In the first 4 months of 2020 , we had sales across the globe , including in North America , U.K. , Australia , Germany and Mauritius . <p> Fourth , the demand for Dayforce Wallet is meeting our expectations . We launched dayforcewallet.com , and the launch comes at a time when we believe workers need it most . We have a broad spectrum of customers across industries looking to implement Dayforce Wallet to support their work during this unprecedented time . On April 9 , we activated our first customer , Danone . We will provide updates on Dayforce Wallet usage in future quarters , and we continue to expect to have more than 100 organizations live by the end of the year . <p> Finally , we announced an agreement to acquire Excelity . Building on our recent investments in Australia and New Zealand , we believe that this acquisition , which is expected to close in the second quarter , will position Ceridian as a leading HCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 300 clients , which produces than 1.2 million payslips and operates its major payroll platform in 13 countries , including India , China , Singapore , Hong Kong , Japan , Indonesia , South Korea , Malaysia , the Philippines , Taiwan , Thailand , Australia and New Zealand . This acquisition provides us an opportunity to land and expand in the Asia Pacific region , accelerating market presence and pave the way to extend the Dayforce native payroll platform to the Asia Pacific region . <p> In addition to the Excelity acquisition , we began development of major payroll engines for Germany , Mexico and Mauritius , which are expected to be completed in the next 18 months . <p> I would now like to hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions . <p> Great . Hope everyone is safe and healthy . So on Dayforce specifically , can you just comment a little bit more about sort of the pipeline building efforts ? I know in your shareholder letter , you talked a little bit about what you 're seeing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more and talk about what you and your customers are talking about and how that pipeline building is going ? <p> So thanks for the -- Daniel , thanks for the question . Look , in Q1 , we saw , obviously , very strong Dayforce revenue growth . As mentioned , Dayforce recurring grew by 30.4% on a constant currency ex-float basis . The Dayforce total revenue grew by 31.9% , ex-float and on a constant currency basis . <p> In the first quarter , we continued to see sales towards the end of March . And as mentioned , and as outlined in the stockholder letter , we will continue to see sales in the month of April . We 're seeing sales really across the industry , obviously , a little bit more impacted in the hospitality and the retail area . But other than that , it appears that there is still strong demand for human capital management solutions . <p> Great . And then on the acquisition that you announced today , those are a lot of countries . Beyond sort of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you see this transition happening ? And then you 've got both the acquisition you made last year and this new acquisition . Can you just frame how we should be thinking about how this could -- the moving pieces over the next year or 2 for all these different countries you 're moving into ? <p> Sure . So Daniel , we 've spoken a lot about this in the past . Our goal is to be in more than 20 countries with native payroll engines within the next few years . And so this acquisition , obviously , is very consistent with that . Excelity positions us as a leading provider in the APJ region almost immediately . It is also consistent with what we 've spoken about from an M&amp;A strategy , which is effectively to seek out players in particular regions , to acquire effectively around 2 to 3x the multiple of revenue and over a period of time , leverage their know-how and their market presence to accelerate the launch of native Dayforce into those particular regions . So on a several year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those regions , obviously , with the full HCM suite capacity . <p> Congratulations . Hope everyone 's safe . With regards to -- it 's obviously early in April , but can you talk a little bit about what you 're seeing in your client base , the existing client base , just in terms of the number of employees that they 're laying off or furloughing , and how , from a temporary perspective , we should think about the impact of that , both in terms of like is there a difference between a furlough versus a layoff ? And how we should think about base subscription fees versus a direct PEPM relationship ? <p> Thanks a lot , Mark . So I 'm going to break it up into Dayforce and into Powerpay separately . Just as a reminder , Powerpay accounts for a little bit less than 10% of total revenue . <p> On the Dayforce side , we get paid for both active and inactive employees . Furloughed employees count as inactive employees . And so we still do receive the recurring revenue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a lot of detail . We explained that up to April 15 , the employees part of Dayforce systems had increased 17% year-over-year , but it was 5% less than the amount that we had expected at the beginning of the year . When I look at the employee count , and we monitor these obviously on a daily basis , it appears that beyond the Dayforce side and on the Powerpay side , it looks like the layoffs or the furloughing of employees has really flattened out , and we 've seen a little bit of increases over the last week on both of the actual products . So on the Dayforce side , we 're impacted only when employees get terminated , not when they get furloughed . <p> On the Powerpay side , slightly different . We get paid on a per paycheck basis . About 40% of the Powerpay revenue is recurring . The other 60% is early monthly fees that is not dependent on headcount . Up until April 15 , we 've seen a 13% decline in terms of headcount . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts for just less than 10% of the revenue . <p> That 's great . And then with regards to just the wallet , it sounds like that 's going really well . Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of the latest thoughts in terms of how the business model 's going to work from a revenue recognition perspective and what take-up 's going to be like within the clients and what you 've seen internally with your own workforce ? <p> So again , very early days , given that we just took live the first customer , Danone , on April 9 . We spent effectively the first quarter getting ready for launch , and that 's not only the product with all of the marketing , assets and implementation assets as well . We have a backlog of clients that are waiting now to go live with wallet . We waited really until the 1st of April because of some of the quarter end processes we wanted to get through . And then there was a slight delay in getting the apps published on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the application can now be downloaded in the U.S. on both of those . <p> The reaction from our own employees , who 've been using the system , is very , very positive . It 's a very clean experience in terms of activating the wallet . Very similar to the Dayforce app . When you download the Dayforce Wallet , it 's almost like if you have Facebook and you load Instagram , it shares the same type of authentication method and such . So it 's really very easy to use . The -- we do personalization of the actual plastic , which comes and looks really , really sharp . And then we also have the touch-less capability through either the phone or if you have an Apple Watch and such . The reactions have been very , very positive . <p> I hope you guys stayed safe . Can you just -- the one thing that was a focus for you guys in recent quarters was to kind of highlight the strength you have with continuous payroll around the integration or , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some very interesting wins in the U.K. , for example , with the coffee chain , et cetera , like the rural industries that have hourly workers . And so now that the screens that came up , like , what 's your footprint there in terms of your pipeline for the current customers ? Does that kind of create a bigger impact for you compared to other HR players ? Or is it that just like a growth opportunity , and the customers that you guys have is much more broad-based ? Maybe just give us some color on that because that would help us a lot . <p> Yes , yes . It 's for -- if you look at -- yes . Wherever you 're in an installed base . And if you look at the pipeline , like , was that kind of -- because you 've talked a lot about it , but it does n't mean that they all have to be in that space . But a little bit more color there . <p> So mostly , the pipeline obviously has shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical sales . We obviously are spending much more effort now in developing pipeline in what we term surge industries . And we 're still seeing growth in many of those industries . When it comes to the actual historical , Jeremy can correct me , but I believe probably about 14% . Is that correct , Jeremy , of the employee base would be in kind of I 'll call it , retail or hospitality that would be impacted by COVID . We do have a larger footprint in retail , but those would be in groceries and such , some fast food that have n't already been impacted . Even across the retail group , we have n't seen massive layoffs . We 've seen furloughed employees . And as you know , we do get paid for those furloughed employees . <p> Okay , that 's really helpful . Okay , that 's really helpful . And then maybe a follow-up like on float . If you think in like , obviously , the came down . Like can you remind us of how your investment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that might change with the current , kind of rate environment ? <p> Sure . The way we do the float is we effectively break it up between a core portfolio and a liquidity portfolio . In the liquidity portfolio , we basically keep the money in overnight . And in the core portfolio , we obviously use a laddering strategy . So you 're typically , an average life of about 2.5 to 3 years . The -- just the impact of the change in the Fed rate , as you know , has gone down by about 150 basis points , about 25 basis points . On a full year basis , that 's an $18 million headwind for us . We are n't -- obviously , we ca n't do much changes between how we do the investments as the trust funds are AAA-rated . That 's the point system that we have to use investment side . So that effectively determines what percent of your government and what types of corps we 're allowed to invest in . <p> Got it . And then can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape ? Are you seeing anything unusual to call out from competitors , you being more aggressive on price , considering how they do the market , like that ? <p> I hope everybody is doing well . David , maybe first question . Just in the shareholder letter , I saw the comment about rolling in more minimums into the contracts . Could you maybe remind us what the current minimum threshold is on average for the customer base and how that currently works ? And then I have one follow-up . <p> Sure . One -- in current contracts , there is no minimum . We charge on the number of active and inactive employees , typically on the 15th of the month . And we charge 1 month in advance . So we are making some changes to contracting going forward , to provide a minimum , which is obviously a percentage of the employees at time of contracting . <p> Great . Very helpful . And then maybe just on the Bureau business . I know there are plans to maybe accelerate some of the -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with a lot of challenges right now . I 'm curious if you 're seeing customers accelerate the shift off of Bureau and maybe increasingly going to Dayforce ? Or what are your plans on the Bureau side ? And how is that benefiting or impacting Dayforce ? <p> Again , the strategy on Bureau has n't changed . As you know , we aggressively are now trying to end of life the Bureau products with the exception of the tax . Tax is probably about a $50 million business of the remaining Bureau . Every quarter , we move around about $5 million from Bureau to Dayforce , and then there 's probably an equal amount that just goes away as we do n't really have a home for it in the Dayforce type of world . There has n't been any change to each of the pace of approaching customers or the pace of us end of lifing . But as we mentioned prior , by the end of the year , we already expect the aggregate business to be -- and Jeremy can kind of provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Josh on for Scott . Do you anticipate any impact to your partner strategy upmarket from COVID-19 given that was just getting launched for new business in 2021 ? Or do these relationships remain on track ? <p> If anything , there 's an opportunity to lean in and strengthen these types of relationships . So in one way , it allows us to basically , in professional services , rely much more on taxing through the use of a larger size as opposed to hiring directly professional services people . <p> Okay , great . And then just a follow-up . Do you expect any delayed impact to business trends in Canada , given that they implemented social distancing after the United States , which has implications for their curve of infection rate ? <p> I honestly do n't see much of a difference between the U.S. and Canada . I 'm not sure who actually did social distancing first . I ca n't remember it . As an organization , we probably did a few weeks ahead of both the U.S. and Canada . What I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From a sales perspective , from a marketing perspective , implementation , customer support , all of that , even in times of non-COVID , is usually done on a non-touch basis . So it does n't really make much of a difference . <p> As I mentioned beforehand , we monitor the employee headcount at all of our customers . And when I look at both Canada and the U.S. , we 've seen a slight increase in employees and customers over the last week . So nothing really to get overly excited about , but there seems to be evidence that the impact of COVID has kind of bottomed out . <p> Hope you 're all doing well . I wanted to ask on implementations . Can you give us a sense of the mix of customers that might be delaying implementations here ? And then any difference in the behavior of the clients that have already started implementations as far as pauses or whether most are still moving forward ? <p> Look , it 's a mix . If I look at the impact of implementations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period that we typically would take live all of the customers from Q1 . The overall impact of COVID in Q1 was probably about $1 million to $2 million in terms of the amount of recurring revenue we would have activated in that particular quarter . So there was some impact , but it definitely was n't a material amount . We did also see some of the kickoffs of new projects get pushed a little bit , but we 're confident that they 'll get restarted relatively soon if they have n't been restarted already . <p> In terms of the impact from the industry , obviously , it 's probably in line with what you would expect . It was a specialty retail -- retailer , it probably was more impacted than , say , if it was an extended care living facility . <p> Okay . And then as far as the demand environment , can you comment on just buying behavior you might be seeing between -- for Dayforce , between major markets and enterprise customers ? And any modules or functionalities within the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? <p> Yes , yes . So let me just add another step that I actually mentioned before . 88% of Dayforce employees are at customers above 500 employees . The vast majority of Dayforce accounts really would be in major markets or in enterprise . I have n't really seen a material difference between behaviors between major markets and enterprise . Now that may be because we have moved upmarket quite significantly over the last year . And you see that in some of the numbers we spoke about in the stockholder letter . For instance , the incremental revenue per Dayforce account increased 63% to $213,196 from $130,998 a year before . So most of our -- obviously , a larger proportion of our customers will be towards the upper end of major markets in the enterprise side . <p> This is Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy . David , you said that furloughing of employees seems to have stabilized , and some have even come back . What is your sense for how many furloughed employees might eventually come back -- or excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on conversations with your customers ? <p> Look , hey Mark ( sic ) Matt , and nice to hear from you . I do n't have the answer to that . In terms of furloughed employees , again , we get paid for furloughed employees . What I can say is when I look at furloughed employees versus active employees at our customer base , the percentage of furloughed employees seems to be going down . So there seems to be a movement in our customer base in activating inactive employees . In terms of employees that they have let go , I do n't know what -- if they will come back to the levels they had previously , but I think we 'll probably get a bit more clarity over the next 6 months or so . <p> Okay . And you also mentioned the sales cycle had extended in some cases . And are those cases mostly in the heavily impacted industry ? And if the sales cycle are extending , are they sort of -- are some of these deals off the table ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your sense for how many will ultimately return to you ? <p> Sure . So there 's a few questions in there . First , we 've seen very few projects get canceled . The pattern seems to be that there 's a push into later quarters . In terms of industry , I do n't know if that was the primary reason for pushes . I believe that in the end of March , it was effectively everyone 's getting ready to work from home and some organizations like us has the maturity and has policy to make it very easy , others did n't . And so the same people that would have made decisions on systems like ours were quite busy in helping their employees get productive and get up to speed from working from home . At the moment , I think there 's kind of a return to work effort that 's going on in a lot of the clients . And that also created a little bit of distraction . But I think we 're actually feeling positive that we 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the , kind of the volume and the momentum of sales that we saw , even in the first month of this quarter . <p> I was just wondering whether customers have been requesting any new functionality or solution sets in the current environments and whether you 're seeing any interest in add-on sales as customer needs change . <p> Great question . So we were quite proactive in this . So very early on in COVID , we made some enhancements to the Dayforce product . The first was we added a COVID tracker , which effectively allows employees to register which offices they 've been to . And then if there is a suspected case of COVID or positive case of COVID , our system can generate a list of people who may have come into contact with the person . And we also enhanced the messaging engine to make it easy to be broadcast via SMS or personal e-mail , so that people could get notified in a very efficient manner . <p> The second thing we did is that we loaded into learning management system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work from home ? How do you manage employees at home ? How do you stay safe ? How do you wash your hands ? And other pieces of really important information . And we added that to all Dayforce instances whether people had the learning management system or not . And we also launched or we activated a public version of Dayforce Learning . That 's available for any organization to use . They can just simply go on , register , load their employees and such , and that provides all the COVID pieces . In the near term , you 'll see us launch a lot of kind of features and communications about return to work and about helping companies prepare to get people back into the offices and as such . <p> In terms of add-on sales , as you know , add-on sales has always been 20% of what we sell . Obviously , there is a strong demand for learning management . There 's obviously -- the other pieces of the application do apply quite nicely in this environment . <p> Great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook . So congrats on the Excelity acquisition . Just wondering if you 've seen -- what you 're seeing in the M&amp;A market right now , if you 've seen any impact of valuations or the number of prospects that are out there . <p> We 're quite laser-focused when we try to do these things . We have started to work on Excelity in 2019 . And yes , COVID obviously did have some impact to timing , but I ca n't say that I 've actually seen any real change in M&amp;A activity in the marketplace . <p> This is Yao Chew on for Brad Zelnick . I hope everyone is staying safe . Just wanted to dive a bit more into the go-to-market strategy and sort of a 2-part question within this . I was glad that you -- seeing how you managed to adapt to the virtual go-to-market motion with the seminars and summit , but there 's always a lot of steps between the top of funnel , between website traffic and qualified leads and final implementation . It 's new to everyone involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottlenecks are , if there are any major ones to call out , and how receptive customers are to this approach ? And on that , does this change any longer-term views on traditional go-to-market given the new resources and ROI or effectiveness that you may be seeing here ? <p> Yes . Look , as you can probably gather from the stockholder letter or even from today 's talk , we 've been chosen to lean in into the current environment to strengthen our organization . And in terms of marketing , we moved very quickly to more of a digital marketing focus . And we started off with our first virtual summit , which effectively had about 2 , 3x the attendance that we typically would see on physical . And the reactions we got from it was very positive . And so from that , we obviously extended that . We did one in Australia . We did one in the U.K. We did another one in North America last week . I believe we have one coming up in the U.K. and Ireland in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with a format that 's very engaging . This one involves customer speakers . We did a very thorough demonstration of the actual product . We answered questions live . We still do now virtual one-on-ones with prospective customers and such , and it seems to be going very nicely . <p> The second part about the digital marketing is that because we really are experts when it comes to payroll and tax . And as you know , with the various government programs in the U.S. and Canada , there 's been a lot of complexity that the customers have had to have understood . And we 've done a lot of very informative webinars , leveraging outside speakers and our own experts , and I think that has improved the brand of Ceridian . In other words , reinforcing how important it is to be experts and be able to do the compliance calculations correctly and have the internal compliance teams that really can help customers adjust as they need to , to remain compliant and to help their employees . Lastly , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . We 're now living in a world where people really would like to do touchless transactions . They really do need to be able to get their earned wages as quickly as possible . And having a mechanism that allows organizations to really get money into the hands of their employees when they need them is obviously a great feature . <p> I had 2 questions . The first is , when you mentioned the competitive landscape , I wanted to ask about pricing in really , in 2 dimensions . Are you seeing any changes in price discovery when there 's new work to be done and/or new bids out there , I meant , and/or are you seeing any customers coming back and asking for price relief , particularly in the most affected industries ? So are you seeing any broad primers or any kind of changes in pricing ? <p> So I do n't think we 've seen any changes in pricing . And as we 've mentioned , we 're making some changes to future contracts in terms of adding minimums to the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that we get paid for furloughed employees really has provided us with a lot of insulation from COVID . So we are quite fortunate in that regard . <p> In terms of the customers in impacted industries , we 've been quite proactive . We look at our customers as very long-term partnerships , and we want to be able to support them in any way that we obviously can . So in serving industries , we did do a reach out to help them more from a financing perspective during this particular period . That 's not really on a rate reduction basis . <p> Okay . So maybe financing helped , okay . The second is on wallet . You did previously comment that you 've had a backlog build in the very short period of time . I was just wondering if you could revisit on what you think the metrics might be for the maturing of wallet , when we might see some revenues ? Previously you talked about next fiscal year , you were going to see kind of the first wallet revenues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the potential of wallet ? And could there indeed be some revenues as we get towards the end of this fiscal year ? <p> Well , we 're doing the rollout obviously of stuff now . And as much of this stuff is obviously , are going to be activated in the second half of the year , I think that will be a fair statement . I do n't think that we 'll see a material impact from revenue in 2020 . As we get more experience with the product , as we mentioned inside the stockholder letter , we will share that with everyone , so people can start to model . And we 'll start to talk more about the business as we have for information about it .

@@31861241 <h> The Woman Tasked With Saving the Subway Is Still Commuting on It <h> Sarah Feinberg took over the city 's transit in a state of emergency -- and controversy . <p> New York City Transit interim president Sarah Feinberg , 42 , turns her camera for a moment to show me how deserted the 30th floor of 2 Broadway is . " It 's myself , the guy who sits at the front and lets people through the locked door , " she narrates as she pans MTA headquarters . " A woman who basically runs the office is here some days . And then our NYPD liaison is here most days . And that 's it . " The NYCTA , whose very density has been blamed for New York City being the epicenter of the coronavirus , is being run from a ghost town . <p> She swivels back to her own nondescript workspace : beige shades , a monitor behind her head , cherry-veneer cabinetry . Feinberg started in the office March 2 -- five days before Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York -- so there has n't been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up around 5 a.m. in the East Village apartment she shares with her partner , journalist and former Vice News executive Josh Tyrangiel , and works until their 2-year-old daughter wakes up . ( Their nanny has been staying home ; Tyrangiel is for now the primary caregiver . ) Then she either walks or takes the 4 or 5 to the office on a system where ridership plummeted by more than 90 percent and tries to figure out how to dig New York City 's transit out of a disaster worse than anything anyone has seen before . As of this writing , at least 123 transit workers have died of COVID-19 ; facing financial ruin , the state-run MTA is panhandling in Washington for its survival ; anyone who has a choice is avoiding public transportation , and Feinberg is managing the fallout from an unprecedented overnight closure and cleaning of the trains . There 's a saying in transit that you 're only as good as your last rush hour . But what does that mean when the very prospect of peak crowding is terrifying ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever met right now , " says Lisa Daglian , the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA . Does she think Feinberg wants the job permanently ? " Oh God , would you ? Personally , I do n't know if I would want the job on a good day . " <p> Feinberg , who ran the Federal Railroad Administration under President Obama and served on Amtrak 's board , actually said " No " a year ago when Cuomo offered her the MTA chairmanship , a rung above her current gig . She 'd had a baby and , Feinberg says now , " I could n't imagine taking a 24/7 job when she was 1 . " Feinberg agreed to be on the MTA board instead , where she made headlines advocating for an expanded transit police force and , less controversially ( and less effectively ) , station accessibility . <p> Then Andy Byford , nicknamed " Train Daddy " and adored as incorruptible by the press , transit workers , and advocates , resigned and was regaled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week Feinberg started , " had become somewhat intolerable " as he was undercut from above -- meaning by the governor . ( Byford declined to be interviewed . ) On February 23 , Feinberg agreed to step in on a temporary basis . <p> " This is a story about Andrew Cuomo , because every story about the MTA is about Andrew Cuomo , " says the Riders ' Alliance 's Danny Pearlstein . " Andy Byford is not here because of Andrew Cuomo , and Sarah Feinberg is here because of Andrew Cuomo . " <p> Feinberg says of the governor : " I 've sat through just countless , countless hours of meetings with him , where I just find that we land on how to address big , deep , complicated knots of problems in a similar way . " And yet even Cuomo critics like Benjamin Kabak , who blogs at Second Avenue Sagas , would n't say Feinberg is simply the governor 's yes-woman . As a board member , Feinberg " was n't just parroting what he had to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gaps between Andy Byford and Andrew Cuomo . " Daglian calls Feinberg " no nonsense . She is forceful . She is strong . " <p> The cautiously warm reception is a testament to Feinberg 's people skills and work ethic , especially considering she only moved to New York in 2017 . Or maybe , in a stepchild agency dominated by stagnating feuds between city and state leadership , it actually helps : " She 's not immersed in the past of the MTA and all the prior dysfunction , " said Linda Lacewell , a fellow Cuomo appointee to the MTA board . <p> The daughter of a legislator and a federal judge in West Virginia ( Joe Manchin introduced her at her Senate confirmation hearing and reminisced about meeting her as a five or six -year-old ) , Feinberg clocked more years in D.C. Democratic politics than in transportation . She spent nearly seven years at the side of Rahm Emanuel , whom she followed from the House to the White House , where she was the senior advisor to Emanuel , who was Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emanuel told me . " She 's willing to walk into an office and tell you when you 're wrong . " <p> In 2010 , Feinberg 's marriage to then-Obama official and current Pod Save America host Dan Pfeiffer ended . She left the White House for blue-chip communications jobs at Bloomberg LP and later Facebook , but told the White House she intended to come back to public service . " I actually just called the White House and said , ' I 'm ready to come back , ' " she says . They floated chief of staff at the Department of Transportation or the deputy chief of staff at the Pentagon ; Feinberg said she 'd be open to either . " I 'd love to say it 's this long , simmering fascination with locomotives , but it was n't , " she says . <p> When she eventually took over the railroad regulatory agency , it was a sort of a dress rehearsal for managing through this crisis -- major derailments , track fires .

Never let a crisis go to waste . " <p> The question is , an opportunity for what ? Not unlike her boss in those early Obama years , Feinberg faces chafing on the left . It started with her stint on the board championing Cuomo 's crackdown on fare evasion ( and , she would add , sexual assault on the trains ) and to add 500 more cops to the subway . " The policing issue has been a good introduction to the press corps in New York for me , " she says wryly . " I 've tried to be really clear in how I talk about it and why I think it 's important , and I 'm not sure I 've ever been comfortable with the way I then read it .

When I ask about a video of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground in front of her child for not wearing a mask , she says , " Now , if the police are reporting to me , am I going to suggest anyone be arrested for not wearing a mask ? No , of course not . " ( Mayor de Blasio has since said no one else will be arrested or ticketed for not wearing a mask . ) <p> Only weeks ago , MTA workers were n't even allowed to wear their own masks , following CDC guidance that mask wearing was ineffective . ( Tramell Thompson , a subway conductor with a YouTube channel called Progressive Action , titled an April episode referring to MTA chairman Pat Foye " The Inaction of Foye &amp; Feinberg Has Lead to 47 Dead MTA Employees . " It featured a prerecorded condolence message turned pep talk from none other than Andy Byford . ) I ask Feinberg , who calls herself " a believer in government , " if she has any regrets . She says , " I deeply regret that the federal government failed on that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started , as positive cases and exposures mounted , Feinberg had to decide which workers to quarantine and where to reduce service . She ended up having to self-quarantine when a slew of top managers -- her boss Foye , the agency 's chief safety and security officer , and the deputy chief of the MTA police -- tested positive . And as executives worked from home , workers on the ground were sidelined -- at one point , the entire 2 line was out because its crew had been exposed to a single person who had done fitness-for-duty checks on all of them . Absences inevitably led to service cuts which led to crowding . <p> " I felt like anyone can take a photo of one car and post it on Twitter , and that 's my New York Post and New York Daily News story that day , right ?

" Our organizations are alarmed that crowding on particular MTA bus and train routes poses an imminent public-health threat to New Yorkers , especially black and brown communities where the city 's essential workforce is concentrated , " read their open letter . <p> Feinberg was furious and took what the advocates said was a systemic claim as a personal charge of racism . " I am personally , deeply offended by the suggestion that I , or anyone working for me or with me , would in any way discriminate , " she wrote in an emailed response that I saw , which she asked to be shared with all of the groups . " You do not know me well yet , and you certainly do not know me well enough to suggest that I would allow this to happen on my watch . I hope in time you will know me well enough to know that any form of discrimination is anathema to who I am and everything about me . " <p> She 's stillfurious when I ask her about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling . To have someone in the middle of a crisis write us a letter saying , ' No. 1 , you 're not doing a good enough job in the middle of a devastating crisis . And No. 2 , we think the reason you 're not doing a good enough job is not because this is a massive global pandemic and not because our federal government has failed and not because there 's a whole issue with who are essential workers ... but because we think you do n't care about certain people as much . ' Clearly I 'm not over it . I 'm not getting over that one . " <p> She maintains New York City Transit did n't need to be told to redistribute service to essential workers . " There 's a whole advocacy world that makes a living off of weighing in on how we 're doing our job , " she says . " And they fundamentally do n't understand how we do our job . They fundamentally do n't understand that everyone who works here wakes up and tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Dailey , director of advocacy and organizing at the TransitCenter and one of the organizers of the letter , responded , " Calling on the MTA to think more comprehensively about mobility and racial equity is not a personal attack on any individual or previous efforts , it 's a straightforward recognition that what we have all been doing is broken and needs to be fixed . " ) <p> Conversely , Feinberg is rankled that the head of the New York City Stock Exchange said that employees could come back as long as they do n't take public transportation . " Did you see that ? " she says heatedly . " They did n't say , ' You 're not allowed to come to work if you go to an unauthorized party in Greenwich . " <p> The problem for the MTA is that it 's not just stockbrokers who are loath to board a train . In a poll by the research company Elucd , 44 percent of New Yorkers said they plan to avoid public transportation even after lockdown is lifted . The most visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. for cleaning , even though the CDC is now deemphasizing the risks of surface transmission . Feinberg freely concedes that closing is also about psychological reassurance for potential riders . " People need to know that we 're cleaning , but they need to see that we 're cleaning , " says Feinberg . ( Conveniently , the closures , which advocates like Kabak worry will kill 24-hour service forever , also provided the MTA a lever to eject the homeless population from the train . ) The MTA is also experimenting with using UV lights for cleaning . <p> Most epidemiologists agree that sustained contact in closed spaces is prime spreading territory , but decrowding the trains is a lot harder than hiring contractors to spray down cars . Feinberg has been encouraging " the business community " to continue telework or stagger the days of the week employees are expected to be in the office and , barring that , to be more flexible with latecomers whose commute is disrupted because they 're avoiding crowds . <p> Pat Foye also floated the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first heard it , I could n't figure out how it was going to work , but the longer I 've spent thinking about it , the more I think it has real promise , " says Feinberg diplomatically . For example , rather than reserving a particular train departure , she says , riders could reserve time ranges that would help the system make decisions about capacity . Or , she says , there could be an app telling you which cars in a given train are at capacity . <p> Though a few Upper East Side stations now have markers on the platform floors to indicate social distancing , Feinberg is pretty blunt in calling the six-feet-apart standard unattainable . " It 's not possible in New York City , " she says . A ridership drop of 90 percent , she points out , still meant 400,000 riders a day , and in recent weeks it 's started to slowly tick up When a routine disruption , like a rail defect , delays the next train , " you have a crowding issue like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis may be Feinberg 's strongest asset . " The most important piece of this job at this moment is to be extremely straightforward and candid with New York about what the system is right now , what it can be , and what their expectations should be . " She is similarly uncoy when asked about whether she 'll stay in the job longer than whatever " interim " means . <p> " I do n't find the job workable with the way that I want to be a mom and a partner on a permanent basis , " she says . " This is the best job in transportation . It is interesting . It 's exciting . It 's fascinating . It is super-challenging . It will push you harder than you 've ever been pushed and make you grow in ways that you never thought you would grow , right ? And that is the kind of job I yearn for and want desperately . But it is not a 40-hour-week job . You 're not doing taxpayers service by spending 40 hours a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workforce a service . So you 're letting someone down , and I am not at this moment willing to let my family down like that .

Cybercriminals are using newer ways to defraud mobile phone and computer users , using covid-19 as a cover . <p> As the pandemic spreads , covid-19-related cyber frauds are also on the rise . The rise of cybercrime in India is apparent with the advisories that banks , non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) , National Payments Corp . of India ( NPCI ) , ministries and various government departments have issued . <p> " There is no India-specific data yet . But in most of the developed countries , there is a sudden jump in covid-19 cybercrimes , " said Pavan Duggal , a Delhi-based lawyer who specializes in the field of cyber law . ActionFraud , the UK 's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrimes , saw covid-19-related frauds increase by 400% . <p> Remember that it 's only rarely that you will get back the money lost to cyber fraud .

Fraudsters call up gullible borrowers and pose as bank representatives . They inform the targets that their lenders are giving a moratorium on the loan and the borrower wo n't need to pay two EMIs , as per the Reserve Bank of India 's directives . In the process , they can trick borrowers into sharing their bank details . Once they convince the borrowers , fraudsters ask them to share the OTP ( one-time password ) by giving them the impression that the OTP is the confirmation code for availing the moratorium , when actually it is for a bank transaction that borrowers may be doing . Once the borrower shares the OTP , he loses money . <p> " There is only one rule to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share any details with anyone , " said Prashant Mali , a Mumbai-based lawyer and cybersecurity expert . <p> Experts said that these are typical social engineering frauds .

However , many fraudsters made similar UPI IDs , such as pmcares@pnb , pmcares@hdfcbank , pmcare@yesbank , pmcare@ybl , pmcares@icici , and so on , to defraud people . There were so many fake IDs that the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) also issued a warning along with banks , ministries and police departments recently . Even State Bank of India released an advisory to its customers to be cautious of fake IDs such as pmcarefund@sbi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once we came across the fake IDs , we jumped into action with partner banks in our ecosystem to act on it .

" We will be dealing with it . And we just have do the best we can . " <p> So far , the state health department has recorded four COVID-19 outbreaks in Washington related to child care facilities . But that may be an underestimate due to a lack of testing and contact tracing . <p> The case in Spokane at Just Imagine Child Care Center was linked to one other positive test , according to the Spokane Regional Health District . Health officials will not say whether that person is a family member but pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The state Department of Children , Youth and Families began doling out grant funding about two weeks ago to thousands of child care providers that have remained open statewide , including about 155 Spokane providers who received about $1.3 million in total . <p> But the one-time grants -- ranging from $6,500 to $14,000 per provider , depending on the size of their operation -- is likely a drop in the bucket for most . <p> Many of the providers who have stayed open through the pandemic have faced declining enrollment , often meaning fewer dollars contributing to overhead costs . <p> Meanwhile , the child care providers that already closed ca n't apply for state grant funding . In Spokane , that was about 27% of providers , or nearly 80 businesses , as of Wednesday , according to DCYF . <p> About 22% of child care providers statewide , or about 1,200 businesses , were closed on Wednesday . <p> Out of 2,500 Washington child care providers who responded to a recent survey , approximately 41% said they were at risk of permanent closure , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Child Care Aware of Washington . <p> The same survey also found just 49 of those respondents received federal economic disaster loans and 202 received federal Paycheck Protection Program loans . <p> Obtaining personal protective equipment , such as masks and gloves , in addition to regular cleaning supplies and hand sanitizers , has become a struggle , and providers do not have access to the state 's stock of supplies . <p> As more people head back to work , experts are concerned there may not be enough child care to go around . Many providers were already at or near capacity for child care before the wave of pandemic closures . <p> And the potential for a COVID-19 outbreak in a child care facility , along with the subsequent tracing of virus exposures , poses another potential challenge . <p> " Before this even started we had a crisis with child care , " said Lee Williams , executive director of Community-Minded Enterprises , which runs the nonprofit Child Care Aware of Eastern Washington . " It was not a stable business plan . ( Providers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising expenses . " <p> " A lot of them that have closed ( during the pandemic ) , it just was n't worthwhile for them to stay open , " Williams said . <h> Closing down <p> Until about two weeks ago , Blueprints for Learning , which runs the Community Building Children 's Center downtown , was counted among Spokane 's temporary closures . <p> An average day at that point was one toddler and a few preschoolers in attendance , compared to the center 's regular capacity for nine toddlers and 20 preschoolers . <p> A week later , as concerns about community transmission grew and daily attendance became too difficult to anticipate , the center closed . Then came Gov . Jay Inslee 's " Stay Home , Stay Healthy " order . <p> Still , the closure was only supposed to last through mid-April , Bertucci said . <p> During the closure , Blueprints for Learning reduced tuition by 50% , which families understood was an investment in keeping the center open , according to Bertucci . Staff also continued to hold daily music classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furlough its staff and reduce hours , Bertucci said . Payroll Protection Program loan funds arrived at the beginning of May . <p> Bertucci said increased testing , contact tracing and widespread masking measures helped the center feel confident about reopening earlier this month , as well as knowing there also was a smaller chance of having a case in a child . <p> " We still do n't know everything now , but we know quite a bit more than we did several weeks ago , " Bertucci said . <p> Attendance climbed back toward regular levels upon reopening , with the toddler room at half capacity and the preschool about 85% full with regular students and school-aged siblings . Some families who are n't attending still pay tuition to hold their child 's spot in the program . <p> Bertucci said the center adopted an electronic attendance system for parents to use curbside via cellphones , installed touchless faucets and soap dispensers , and rearranged classrooms for smaller group sizes . All staff members are wearing masks . <p> Before reopening , Bertucci said staff spent two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , receive one-on-one tours through the rearranged facility and share how their children had been coping at home during the pandemic . <p> " That 's a big transition to be back together , " Bertucci said .

" <p> Children are spending more time outside to limit the time they are in close quarters with one another , Bertucci said . Staff have also taken cleaning " up another notch . " <p> " And we are trusting our community of families to keep their bubbles ( of contact ) really small because they just connected their bubbles to a lot more families , " Bertucci said . <p> " It 's uncomfortable , but it comes down to doing the best we can , " she added later . <p> As a small center , Blueprints for Learning qualifies for $6,500 in state grant funding , which Bertucci said could be used to offer financial relief to families and staff .

So when those children do n't attend , that revenue is lost . <p> Funds from the state 's grant program will cover about 15% of the center 's payroll for a month , which runs about $100,000 , according to Jasmin . <p> The center closes 30 minutes early each day for extra cleaning and all rooms in the facility are operating at half capacity , Jasmin said .

That number was nearly 23,000 for the entire state . <p> But with more people returning to their workplaces and fewer providers open to take in their kids , experts worry about the looming lack of child care .

First 1000 cases happened in 8 weeks , second one in 4 days , the third one in 3 days , and the fourth 1000 in two days , and thereafter a thousand new patients every day . Like in these other countries , it probably happened in India because of airline traffic-but not because of people coming from China , all of whom were quarantined very early , but likely because of Italians who had carried the virus , who were tourists here . And a number of the early cases actually involved Italians . So it arrived after it had fully seeded in Italy , and the testing was pretty small at the beginning . What we expect is that this is probably because of testing not being adequate , similar to what happened in the early stage of the epidemic in the United States , as well , where it suddenly catches fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes off . In India , it is not clear where it will catch up this way if at all , though the Tablighi Jamaat congregation has emerged to be one major source . There is no evidence that the temperature and the humidity are slowing down the virus.Health Infrastructure as a Challenge:And we 've got a lot of compounding problems , which are that the health-system capacity is generally weak across the country . The number of hospital beds one bed for every 2000 people is remarkably low . It 's probably a fifth of what the U.K. has , for instance . And it 's also got a population that has tuberculosis and respiratory issues and pneumonia and high rates of smoking and air pollution . So , the trajectory of the disease in this population is going to be unclear . It is to be noted here that already 63 doctors and nurses have tested positive even at this early stage of the spread of the disease in India . Also about a third of the country 's adults are hypertensive , and about one-tenth of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to compound the problem . Thankfully the Indian Council for Medical Research ( ICMR ) has ordered for large scale testing of symptomatic patients which till now has been only 30 tests for every million people.Surely some communities have got the disease and transmission has started . We 've already seen cases in the slums of Mumbai , as you know , are some of the biggest slums in the world , with millions of people living next to each other . Then the Tablighi Jamaat congregation of some 4000 people in the narrow confines of Nizamuddin in the second half of March has led to the largest spike of cases spreading to Delhi , Tamil Nadu , Telengana etc . The mass exodus of migrant labourers from Delhi-NCR mainly to UP-Bihar , the huge congregation of devotees in Tirupati and Ayodhya recently and the mass celebrations at the end of March 22 Janata Curfew are yet to be seen over the next two weeks if they were potential carriers of the disease . The virus has been seen earlier to appear where it sort of stays quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in symptomatic cases , typically the elderly . India 's population above the age of sixty-five is much smaller than that of Italy and certainly of China as well . That 's something which has a bit of a protective effect . Lockdown Revisited:The government 's shutdown order , at one level , seems sensible , though might have been a week delayed . At another level , it appears akin to a lot of what this government does , like demonetization : implemented hurriedly without notice like of two days in Australia and New Zealand or three days in Singapore , without a ton of thought about how it was going to be put into effect . The horrific human cost of this lockdown , even if it 's necessary , is already quite high . We have no idea about the rural distress , what 's happening out there . We have not seen the end of this lockdown story . Flitch says 2% of GDP growth will go down in next quarter and a business daily says 7 million jobs in organized sector will go to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proactively to prevent death is not very popular , because the public will never give credit for deaths they averted . The public will only blame them for the damage they caused . So , from that perspective , the government has been decisive on lockdown , however ill prepared one , and completely ill prepared for the economic recession setting in.The Rural Challenge:India has a really weak surveillance system for reporting diseases . So we wo n't actually get to observe rural deaths or rural cases , because if someone who is poor in a village is dying of respiratory distress it wo n't record . Only around a fifth of India 's deaths are actually certified and recorded . The health indicators differ vastly across India , largely due to the action-inaction of the state governments . For example , while Kerala has admirable health indicators , some parts of Bihar has indicators as bad as sub Saharan Africa . Then , the other part is that we do n't actually know what 's going to happen to them in terms of immediate issues which relate to hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its entire population , just from a public stock . But it 's not clear that the food is getting to those places , or that it can in such a short period of time.And , with the entire health system geared toward COVID-19 response , as it correctly should , we may also see some of the other things ( TB , malaria , etc ) get out of control , as happened in West Africa during Ebola , for instance . Even in other countries which are facing these kinds of pandemics , we see the rest of the health services take a hit for a while . A large part of the country is really in the informal economy . So they depend on agriculture . The production side is impacted in places where farmers are affected by the lockdown , and they are unable to sell their crops . Additionally , there is going to be a crush of migrants , who were previously working in cities and sending money back to villages , who are now out of work and back in villages themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will certainly take a hit in terms of health &amp; farm economy . Possible Way Out:Massive build-up of health-infrastructure is the immediate need along with large number of focused affected community-specific testing of Corornavirus . India has only tested around 130 people in every million , decidedly the least in the world , and lower than 258 of Pakistan . Protective gears for healthcare workers , half of a million ventilators , millions of masks and gloves , large quantum of necessary drugs , etc are needed . Next , India needs full insurance and travel protection for all government and private healthcare , sanitary , banking sector , essentials supplies etc.Complete deferment of all EMIs , rent and personal direct taxes for a minimum of three months and a maximum of six months to help people cross the hurdle . The 18 crores of Jandhan Accounts including PM Kisan beneficiaries must get support of Rs.5000 a month for three months minimum , apart from MNREGA workers getting three months payment upfront . Old age pensioners must get three months of pension upfront in their accounts.For all these and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its 2.7 trillion dollar economy , which amounts to around 9 lacs crores , whereas the government of India has so far allotted Rs.1.7 lac crores . This is abysmally low in front of 18% of GDP being given for Combat COVID mission in Germany , 14% in UK , 8% in USA and 4% in China . Hope we learn the lessons and before it is too late . April 2020 is a make or break month for India and it must act now . * ( The author is a media academic , columnist and television panellist , and is currently the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Kolkata based Adamas University . )

He stepped down on a day several USSF board members issued extraordinary rebukes that criticized the governing body 's legal filings . Among them were Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber and Parlow Cone , the federation 's vice-president . <p> A night earlier , U.S. women wore their warmup jerseys inside-out to hide the federation crest before a game against Japan . Several of the federation 's sponsors issued statements this week backing the players and condemning the USSF , including The Coca-Cola Co. , Anheuser Busch Cos . Inc. , The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Volkswagen Group . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USSF board . <p> " It has become clear to me that what is best right now is a new direction , " Cordeiro wrote .

It was unacceptable and inexcusable . " <p> " I did not have the opportunity to fully review the filing in its entirety before it was submitted , and I take responsibility for not doing so . Had I done so , I would have objected to the language , " he wrote . <p> The legal papers were submitted to federal court in Los Angeles as part of the USSF 's defence of the gender discrimination lawsuit filed by women 's national team players last year .

The players did not smile in the pregame team photo . <p> Players took to social media to voice their displeasure . Christen Press posted a photo of the unsmiling team , writing : " It is the great honour of my life to play this sport and represent this country . Every woman deserves equal pay and every institution anywhere that does n't value women as much as men must change now .

Sibley has faced 130 balls , Denly faced 111 . It should all mean , hopefully , that England 's shot-makers in the middle order could maybe , for once , face bowlers who have n't got their tails up . We shall see ... <h> OVER 47 : ENG 109/2 ( Sibley 44* Root 7* ) <p> Maharaj , bowling his left-armers over the wicket , is brilliantly reverse-swept by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tries the same shot the next ball though but does not play it as well . It rips out of the rough and hits QdK in the chest . de Kock got a sore one on the heel of the heel/base of the hand a couple of overs ago . <h> OVER 46 : ENG 104/2 ( Sibley 44* Root 2* ) <p> Nortje . Root swivel-pulls the first ball away for one . Nortje wholehearted , quick and pretty accurate , this is a decent over.A couple more singles , though , take England 's lead to 150 . <p> England have one more over to get through before they can mark this up as very encouraging session , not just in and of itself but I think in the context of how they are trying to develop the Test team . <h> OVER 45 : ENG 101/2 ( Sibley 43* Root 0* ) <h> OVER 44 : ENG 101/2 ( Sibley 43* Root 0* ) <p> Denly is angry with himself as he stomps off but he has played a good hand for his team there . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tests from hit-and-giggle to digging in , he and the coaching staff are entitled to view that 111-ball stay as something of a proof of concept . <p> Joe Denly falls for 31 , his Test average . He constantly feels one innings away from a breakthrough . Has reached 10 in 20 of his 23 Test innings , 20 in 14 of them , 30 in 11 , 50 in 6 , and 100 in 0 . A strike-rate of just under 40 is a factor . <p> Here comes Joe Root . Nortje , who strikes me as a direct , uncomplicated sort of a guy , greets the opposition captain with a quick , hostile bouncer . Standard . Root does not play that especially convincingly . <h> WICEKT ! Denly c Pretorius b Nortje 31 <p> That 's it ! That is the breakthrough . A short ball from Anrich , Denly has a go at it . Pretorius has done his fellow pacer a favour in the deep with a really good running catch , tumbling forward to pluck that a few inches off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86/1 ( Denly 24* Sibley 36* ) <p> Time for a bit of a change , and Nortje is certainly that . He 's impressed so far in his neophyte Test career . Quick and wholehearted with the ball , and has batted gamely down the order . Denly pulls him , there are a couple of men back for that . Four off the over . <h> OVER 35 : ENG 81/1 ( Denly 21* Sibley 35* ) <h> OVER 34 : ENG 79/1 ( Denly 20* Sibley 34* ) <p> Sibley drives Rabada handsomely through the off side ! Shot sir . Four runs for that , and I 'd award a spotter 's badge for the rarity as well , DS not being a noted cover player . Nearly a mix up with the running later in the over , mind you . They get home just about . <h> OVER 33 : ENG 74/1 ( Denly 20* Sibley 29* ) <p> Maharaj to Denly , starting to see a bit of turn now , maybe the effects of the heavy roller - used twice this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem to much between " block " and " WALLOP " . But still there , which is the thing . <p> Bit disrespectful of Nasser Hussain and Mark Nicholas to refer to Vernon Philander as the heavy roller #SAvENG <h> OVER 30 : ENG 74/1 ( Denly 20* Sibley 29* ) <p> It 's Kagiso Rabada . The extra paces wakes Joe No Pants Denly up , he 's chipped the ball through the covers , not sure he was in control of that . Rabada finds , and hits , a crack in the pitch ! That one misbehaves . <h> OVER 28 : ENG 71/1 ( Denly 17* Sibley 29* ) <p> Vernon , floaty , good line , but not doing a lot with the ball . England taking no chances . It 's yet another maiden for Vern . Fine by me . Keep the South Africans out there , that has to be the policy . England have plenty of time to build this lead . <h> OVER 24 : ENG 58/1 ( Denly 13* Sibley 20* ) <h> OVER 23 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa were becalmed against the spinner yesterday , Bess was really allowed to bowl 27 overs without doing much with the ball . England do n't want to fall into that trap , perhaps - because here comes Joe Denly ! He 's blatted the ball over mid off for four ! There was a man back there in that region but he hit it well enough . <p> Kevin Pietersen thought it was a bit risky - he tells Talksport listeners that Denly is always playing Maharaj off the front foot , meaning that he can not rotate the strike , so he has to take on the big shot . " It is a technical flaw . He does not have the ability to rotate the strike so he has to play the release shot . And any slight miscalculation and that is out . There 's only one boundary fielder on - and he is in that area .

No turn to speak of . He 's got a slip and a short leg , more of a silly mid on really , Sibley allows Maharaj to bowl that over . Neither the bowler nor the batsman putting much pressure on the other . Maiden . <h> Lunch interval <p> Pippa Field takes her cap after a spell of sustained , hostile blogging and goes off for a lunch she describes as " depressingly healthy . " Alan Tyers here for the afternoon session . I 've had a croissant . And another croissant . So something to build on there . <p> England meanwhile will , I think , be enjoying their luncheon : a decent morning 's work . They got through the remaining South African batting pretty efficiently and have reached 52 for the loss of just one wicket . For a Test side who have made 50/3 very much their signature score over the last couple of years , that is pleasing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sibley 18* ) <p> Keshav Maharaj on for a quick twirl of the arm before lunch . Denly 's defence holds firm though and that 's lunch . <p> 60 runs from the session , mainly for England after they knocked off those two South African wickets early courtesy of a certain evergreen James Anderson . Zak Crawley looked promising but he fell for 25 . A learning curve for him . <h> OVER 16 : 48/1 ( Denly 5* Sibley 18* ) <p> It 's a bit flat here as we meander to lunch . South Africa have been unable to turn the screw after that wicket as England gradually rebuild . The complexities of Test cricket and why it is so intriguing . <p> Oh that 's a bit of excitement as a shorter one from Nortje bounces past the ducking Denly 's chin . A couple of singles before Sibley confidently finds the gap in the field backward of square to notch up a further four runs . <h> OVER 15 : 43/1 ( Denly 4* Sibley 14* ) <p> Rabada is done bowling for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretorius for lbw , especially as Sibley is rubbing his elbow and replays clearly show the ball hitting his funny bone . <p> Sibley responds with a lovely boundary through mid-wicket off a fuller delivery . <h> State of play <h> OVER 10 : 27/0 ( Crawley 25* Sibley 2* ) <p> Anrich Nortje into the attack for South Africa , replacing Philander . <p> Nortje finds a crack straight away , with an edge from Crawley flying over the vacant gully for a boundary . That 's more controlled from Crawley a few balls later , getting the levers working to crack it out towards forward of square leg . Superb fielding from Pretorius stops the boundary and keeps it to two runs . <p> A swing and a miss and then a solid drive straight to mid off finishes of the over and brings up drinks . <h> OVER 8 : 21/0 ( Crawley 19* Sibley 2* ) <p> Philander , into his fourth over , tries to entice Crawley into a shot but he is not tempted . The South African drew the opener into an outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Again he shoulders arms and does n't give anything away on the next couple either . Philander chucks a few words down to the England batsman after failing to find a crack on the crease . The last delivery is too straight and Crawley works it away for a boundary . <h> OVER 7 : 17/0 ( Crawley 15* Sibley 2* ) <p> Short leg is in for Crawley as South Africa aim to keep the pressure on the England opener . That would not have been part of the plan though as Crawley flicks it fine for a boundary . And then another through backward square leg . A good response from the Kent man . <h> OVER 5 : 12/0 ( Crawley 10* Sibley 2* ) <p> Ouch ! Crawley attempts the pull shot but the ball hits his arm and then ricochets right up into his grille . A quick check of the helmet and play continues . <p> Rabada giving him some lip , verbally , too as Crawley 's feet hardly move on the next couple . He then ducks into another short one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly that opening smooth over from Crawley seems a long time ago . <h> OVER 1 : 8/0 ( Crawley 8* Sibley 0* ) <p> Rabada takes the new ball in hand from the Kelvin Grove End . Thunders in towards Crawley who leaves it confidently and then strokes it through the leg-side for four . Talk about nerve-settler . And back to sensibly leaving on the next . Another confidence-booster for the newbie opener as he drives straight back down the ground for another boundary . <p> Eeeek ! All that good work nearly undone as he looks to drive again but is a touch early and the ball squirts under his bat , narrowly missing the stumps . <h> South Africa 223 all out ( trail England by 46 runs ) <p> Whatever England ate for breakfast clearly did the trick , with South Africa dismissed in under half an hour . He may not even have played this Test had everyone been fit but James Anderson finishes with 5-40 from 19 overs to put England right in the driving seat in this Test . <p> Every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test with Ben Stokes the slip-catcher extraordinaire . He becomes the first England fielder to take five catches in a single Test innings . <p> Disappointment for South Africa but with inexperienced England openers and a brand new cherry in hand , there is still hope . Game on . <h> OVER 88 : 222/9 ( Philander 16* Nortje 4* ) <h> OVER 87 : 221/9 ( Philander 15* Nortje 4* ) <p> Run out chance ! Groans from the England players . They could have had the innings wrapped up there . <p> Philander , eager to get the runs , goes for a single that is really not on after slicing to gully . Nortje is stranded but Pope 's effort fails to hit the wickets . Anderson then sends a jaffa down , seaming away off a good length , which nearly catches out Nortje . <p> After holding firm off the next two , the tailender then clips down to the boundary to relieve the pressure and blocks the last . <h> OVER 86 : 216/9 ( Philander 14* Nortje 0* ) <p> Barmy Army understandably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broad gets his first action of the day from the Wynberg End . <p> Pressure on Philander certainly now to try and eek out some crucial runs for South Africa after that first over . That 's not the way to do it though as he wafts at one outside off and fails to connect . Ugly . He does manage to punch one through the off side to leave Nortje to face the final delivery which he shoulders arms to . <h> Nearly time for play to start <p> Vernon Philander would love to sign off his Newlands swansong on a winning note . He will be called upon with the ball later but first there are matters to attend to with the bat , with the South African 13 not out . The all-rounder is moving to Somerset this year . <p> Joining him at the crease today though is Kagiso Rabada . What can the hosts add to their overnight tally ? Jimmy Anderson warming up for the first over . <h> Early cloud cover <p> Even with one of the stands under construction , it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much to tick off the bucket list I 'd say . The England fans will be in fine voice again , hopeful of a few early wickets . I 'm told no rain forecast for today , despite the early cloud . <h> Good morning <p> And welcome to day three of the second Test in Cape Town . <p> As our cricket correspondent in Cape Town , Scyld Berry , wrote at the close of play yesterday , there 's ' life in the old dogs yet ' . He was , of course , referring to England 's top two Test wicket-takers James Anderson and Stuart Broad who helped England turn a wicket-less second session into a highly profitable third one to help the tourists forge a path back into the series . Together they took five wickets for only 70 runs to give England every chance of yet winning this match - and series . Not bad for players who were at the risk of being dropped if a certain Jofra Archer had been fit . <p> In plain numbers , South Africa reached 215-8 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 269 all out . As well as the contributions of veteran fast bowlers Anderson and Broad , 21-year-old seamer Sam Curran and 22-year-old spinner Dom Bess both made important breakthroughs into the South Africa attack . It also represented a day to cheer finally for Joe Root who has seen his captaincy come under serious scrutiny lately during a difficult tour full of illness and injury . " We reaped the rewards towards the end of the day , " Curran said afterwards . " No wickets in the middle session but we knew the rewards would come if we stuck at it ... I think all in all a good day . Hopefully we can bat big and try and win this game . " <p> The first task this morning for England , however , will be snaffling those final two wickets , preferably nice and quickly before South Africa gain parity . But even if the hosts do nudge ahead , with a pitch starting to show variable bounce and some sideways movement off widening cracks , batting last here will be a tough task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their second innings . Although with England 's batting patterns of late , that is always a big if . A match-deciding day ahead .

@@41667041 <p> It 's the last Davos Playbook for 2020 , and what a week it 's been . Playbook 's Rym Momtaz and Ryan Heath share their Davos takeaways below . But first , what everyone 's talking about this morning : U.S. financier George Soros ' bombshells . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> SHOTS ACROSS THE BOW : " Facebook will work to reelect U.S. President Donald Trump and Trump will protect Facebook , " said Soros in prepared remarks at a dinner Thursday night . He described Trump as " a conman and the ultimate narcissist ... whose politics are a malignant disease , " and Xi Jinping , as a " dictator . " Greta Thunberg got praise . Playbook 's Ryan Heath and Stephen Brown have more . <p> CRITICAL THINKING : Soros ' concern for the 2020 U.S. presidential election and the Western liberal order are seeing him double down on his philanthropic work : He announced he 's investing $1 billion in funding " critical thinking " via a new network of colleges in Europe , which will expand on his Central European University . It is the " most important project " of his life , as Soros put it . <p> SOROS VERBATIM : The U.S. , China and Russia are in the hands of " actual or would-be dictators , " Soros said . And also : " It is now easier to influence than to understand events . " <p> UK NOT A RULE TAKER : Sajid Javid , the only member of Boris Johnson 's Cabinet authorized to break the U.K. government ban on sipping " Champagne with billionaires " in Davos , caught up with Playbook Thursday . Drinking coffee rather than bubbly , the chancellor stuck to his guns on a tight year-end schedule for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU , and elaborated on his comments last week that companies should get used to the idea that the U.K. will not align with the EU 's single market or customs union . " We wo n't diverge for its own sake -- but we wo n't be a rule taker , " Javid said . <p> STILL AT IT : Still in Davos , Greta Thunberg is leading another one of her regular protests at 11 a.m . <p> DRIVING NEXT WEEK : Forget Davos , it 's Alfalfa time , baby . " That 's an annual black-tie gathering where current and past players in the nation 's capital invite corporate titans to join them for a dinner and satirical roasts , " writes POLITICO 's John Harris . " The Davos-Alfalfa pairing serves as a kind of unofficial launch of what is now a yearlong season of corporate and political networking among a certain set of the world 's most influential people . " <h> DAVOS TAKEAWAYS <p> THE ROOKIE TAKE , FROM A FIRST-TIMER : Via Playbook 's Rym Momtaz ... <p> 1 . Speaking truth to power is not the brief . Between WEF Chairman Klaus Schwab 's saccharine remarks after Trump 's speech , and a CEO telling us that Greta Thunberg was needed in Davos to balance out the conversation , Playbook got the distinct impression that the WEF this year was a gathering of rich white dudes hiding behind a 17-year-old girl holding the U.S. president to account . <p> 2 . Continental Europe is a bit player . Sure , Ursula von der Leyen drew a big crowd for her inaugural Davos appearance as the European Commission president , but European Parliament chief David Sassoli was an also-ran , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's keynote barely registered in conversations . American and British corporations dominated , but their Continental fellows were far less visible . " It 's a cultural difference issue , " one WEF official reckoned . <p> 3 . Lack of diversity is a glaring problem . Aside from official political delegations , you 'd be hard-pressed to find a non-Western , non-male participant . And initiatives like the Female Quotient Equality Lounge , while improving the female presence , also highlight just how outside the nucleus of power ( embodied by the Congress Center ) they remain . <p> 4 . Why are we here again ? Sure , the world 's big-hitters in one place at the same time is a big deal . But this high school reunion for CEOs still feels like a relic from a different time : no audience participation , an exclusionary pecking order , and people networking , yes , but largely in their own circles . <p> THE VETERAN TAKE , FROM AN 8-TIMER : Here 's how Ryan Heath saw things ... <p> 1 . The global elite has priced in President Trump -- they now shrug rather than gasp . Most galling for the U.S. president : a 17-year-old is better at driving the day . <p> 2 . The WEF channeled nearly every conversation toward climate action and sustainability . That was made easier because going green is now profitable a lot of the time . <p> 3 . The future U.K. king is no mere ribbon-cutter : Prince Charles had more political impact here than the whole U.K. government -- and also more than former PM Theresa May , who did n't let her brutal opinion of Davos-goers being " citizens of nowhere " stop her from taking their money ( to speak at a private dinner ) . <p> 4 . Real debate and real inclusion make for better panels ; fake consensus bores . WEF will need to apply that to its official stages if it wants the Congress Center to get its mojo back in 2021 . <p> Channel the fig leaf : Also on the podcast , Stephen Brown discusses Trump and Twitter with Mary Beard , professor of classics at the University of Cambridge . She tells Stephen she was criticized on Twitter for being a token participant in Davos . But even " if you are the fig leaf , " you can " fight back , " she said . " Fig leaves do change things . " She continued : " A little bit of cynicism about Davos is definitely called for , but being too cynical I think misses the way that institutions are made to change by outsiders . " <h> BRINGING IN THE HRYVNIA <p> THE NEW NANNY STATE : Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pitched investors in Davos Thursday -- via video -- with an innovative offer : a government nanny of one 's own . " For those who invest more than $100 million , we will conclude a direct investment agreement with the state , based on the English law . These investors will receive a personal tutor -- a nanny -- from the government , speaking five languages and available on a 24/7 basis to take care of all your issues . " <p> Tax holiday : Zelenskiy 's second proposal is to " provide investors who privatize state-owned enterprises worth $10 million or more in the next two years with a five-year tax holiday . " <p> A threat or a promise ? " Not investing in Ukraine is akin to being George Bell who refused to buy Google for $1 million in 1999 ! So , do not miss out Ukraine , " Zelenskiy concluded . Let it rain hryvnia ! <h> IT AI N'T LOOKIN ' GOOD <p> FALLING SHORT : For all the Davos talk on climate change , corporate commitments and social pressure , the rhetoric still fell far short of the action needed , Columbia University 's Jason Bordoff tweeted . And he told Bloomberg : " Policy is nowhere near the level of rhetoric and ambition -- that was the theme last year , and it 's even more so this year . " <p> WOKING UP : The question is whether all the do-good pledges and globo-speak are actually just globo-bull . It 's not clear that corporations are ready to meet the high expectations they have set among governments and advocates alike , write Stephen Brown and John Harris . <p> HEAD-DESK MOMENT : Asked by the male moderator on a panel on gender balance how a governing coalition with five female leaders works , Finland 's 34-year-old Prime Minister Sanna Marin shot back , " It works like any other government . We do n't need a special meeting room or something . " <p> -- Which illustratesjust how far the world still is from gender parity . And it 's not just a feeling : We 're 257 years away , according to a WEF prediction . Check out POLITICO 's Women Rule podcast here for more . <p> BUT BUT BUT : Areije al Shakar , who heads the Bahrain Al Waha Fund of Funds , sees an upside from the lack of women . She told Playbook : " At least I 'm here ... Sometimes it helps because you stand out , you 're able to manoeuver because there are n't as many blue suits . The novelty comes when you 're a female that 's leading a fund-of-funds -- we 're a rarity . " <p> SDG TROUBLE : " The business community is not moving at the speed or scale needed to deliver the sustainable development goals , " warned Lise Kingo , CEO and executive director of the U.N . Global Compact , on Thursday . To counter that , U.N . Secretary-General Ant ? nio Guterres launched " SDG Ambition " in Davos , supported by SAP and Accenture , to help companies and other organizations incorporate sustainability and the SDGs into their business operations and to measure and manage their performance . <p> **With the odds of a recession in the US rising , geopolitical shifts and trade wars changing the economic landscape and more , economic uncertainty has become the backdrop for European business .

But : " The only one who was articulate was the prime minister of Singapore -- the others made lame jokes , like how great it would be for Trump to be on the dollar , " an attendee told Playbook . <p> DAVOS GROUCH : David Blaine was none too pleased to be asked to take a picture of Lenny Kravitz with a fan at the Salesforce lunch Thursday . <p> SPOTTED III : American " Dancing with the Stars " personality Julianne Hough having what looked like an exorcism at the Equality Lounge on Wednesday .

The WEF initiative is being set up with initial financial support from Marc and Lynne Benioff ( of Salesforce ) . But Playbook ca n't help but wonder , how effective will the program be , when major banks continue investing in fossil fuels ? <p> SNAP ! One tweep shared this description of Davos : " Billionaires telling millionaires how the middle class should live . " ( h/t Mariana Mazzucato ) <p> GET YOUR CHECKBOOKS 2 : Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis caught up with Playbook ahead of his panel appearance . It 's not his first WEF , but it 's been a while : Last time he was here , he was still a venture capitalist . Now , he 's just after capital . Davos " is an opportunity to engage with the business community , to talk about what I consider a very successful first six months in terms of changing the perception of the country abroad , " Mitsotakis said . " The economy is growing rapidly ... under the new government , Greece is open for business and a very attractive destination for foreign capital to invest . " <p> MORE TECH TAX TALK : After a meeting between French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire , U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and OECD Secretary-General ? ngel Gurr ? a on Wednesday , Le Maire confirmed key elements of a provisional tech tax truce , but said the basis for international talks at the OECD level -- which is the heart of the matter and will determine whether an international or a national tax will have to be levied -- still had to be ironed out . They are meeting again today to do so . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business .

Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen fully agrees : " If you do not have a military strength , then people will not listen to you . It is as simple as that , " he told Davos Confidential 's Cristina Gonzalez . <p> CASH AI-GHT , EUROPE SO TIGHT : This afternoon at the TechPark Davos conference , German artificial intelligence business incubator Merantix will announce it has raised ? 25 million to found up to eight new AI startups in Berlin over the coming four years , Janosch Delcker reports for POLITICO Technology Pros . Merantix 's co-founder Adrian Locher told Janosch his company had tried to collect investment from private institutional investors in Europe such as pension funds , but " to this day , this proves to be very difficult , particularly when it comes to early-stage investment . " <h> HE CAME , HE SPOKE , THEY SHRUGGED <p> MEH FEST : " Two years ago U.S. President Donald Trump flew here and took the gathering of elites at the World Economic Forum by storm , " POLITICO 's co-founder John Harris , Florian Eder and Ryan Heath write this morning . " Every conversation seemed to revolve around the American leader and his signature brand of political disruption . Trump came back this year , and was greeted with a shrug . " <p> TALK OF THE TOWN ? In his closing press conference on Wednesday , Trump said everyone around Davos was talking about how well the U.S. economy was doing . That 's not exactly what Playbook has been hearing . One Eastern European white-badge-holder asks : " Did I miss something , or did Trump not mention the EU in his speech ? Was he really only talking about European cathedrals ? " <p> VOTING WITH THEIR HANDSHAKES : The U.K. may be angling for a doubly special relationship with the U.S. post Brexit , but at least two major British figures are publicly defying Trump by showing support for his teenage arch nemesis Greta Thunberg . <p> And the guv : Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also backed Thunberg in her clash with Trump , contrasting her contribution to tackling the climate emergency with the White House 's less helpful approach . Read it at the Guardian . <p> TRUMP CONCEDES ... that Greta has done ( at least ) one thing better than him : " She beat me out on Time magazine , " he said at his press conference , after being told she was only 17 years old . <h> DISCONNECTED DAVOS <p> CURIOUS : Who 's best placed to speak about the 90-plus-day protests in Lebanon ? Must be the politician Lebanese protesters loathe the most , caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil , who is on a panel later this afternoon . To protestors , Bassil embodies the height of nepotism and corruption in an already crowded field of Lebanese politicians . <p> Remember me ? Bassil is the guy who bragged at last year 's WEF about giving lessons to the U.S. and U.K. about " running a country without a budget . " Playbook wonders where exactly Bassil was running his country into ... <p> COME AGAIN ? Big Davos day for Brazil Wednesday , with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes vaunting its " stable democracy " and " complete environment of good opportunities to investors around the world , " as the EU Ambassador to Brasilia put it . He can count on one big supporter , at least : the U.S. <p> Reality check : How does Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro 's flouting of his climate commitments on the Amazon jive with all the talk about climate action and sustainability we have been hearing from the WEF and CEOs all week ? <p> COME AGAIN 2 ? At times laughing and smiling , the Beijing-backed Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that she had to stay on as leader to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus , which has killed 17 people in mainland China . Reuters has the write-up . <h> OH WHAT A NIGHT <p> If you decided to stay in on Wednesday , you really missed out . Fear not , Playbook 's spies fanned out across town and the night delivered some pretty ... uncensored ... moments . <p> RESISTANCE : A drunk and obstinate party-goer at the FT/CNBC bash was seen being physically ejected from the venue . But he so adamantly wanted to stay , he put his feet up against the closed door . <p> TOP DRAWCARD:Jane Goodall wins the Rockstar Cach ? Award , and we have a feeling she will be hard to dethrone . Playbook spotted many white-badge-holders lining up for selfies at the Hard Rock Hotel , where Goodall was Wednesday . <p> SPOTTED 1 : Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai at Davos House until 1:30 a.m. -- we hope he did n't have an early breakfast meeting ! <p> ANGLING FOR THAT DAMEHOOD : Theresa May told her audience at a PwC dinner Wednesday night that the most interesting person she met as British prime minister was the queen . One British Davos-goer exclaimed to Playbook : " She is so vanilla ! " <p> SALT ON SORE WOUNDS : Apparently it is n't enough to wrangle Apple chief Tim ( or Timothy , as his badge reads ) Cook for a selfie on the promenade -- someone actually asked him for one and whipped out their Samsung Galaxy phone to take it . <p> OVERHEARD 1 : At the Journal House from one proud white badge to another : " I 've already slept with half of my consultants . Time to go home . " <p> OVERHEARD 2 : A Brit surveying the scene at a party : " Wow , it 's like the dying embers of multilateral liberalism in here . " <p> HIGHLIGHTING HEALTH WORKERS : Johnson &amp; Johnson 's Paul Stoffels , GAVI CEO Seth Berkley and International Rescue Committee 's David Miliband hosted a press conference at 11.45 a.m. at the WEF media center on the key role of health workers in the fight against global epidemics in light of an ongoing Ebola outbreak in Africa and the emerging threat of coronavirus in China and around the world . <h> INSIDE DAVOS <p> SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY : The WEF shuttle buses are a great way of getting to know people , as we 've previously pointed out . The forced proximity in crawling peak-hour traffic has produced some fascinating chance encounters this week , improving our familiarity with subjects ranging from AI to street art and Indian politics . Favorite comments so far : " My CEO is speaking -- I have to be there ! " and " He 's not my president ! " <p> THUMBS DOWN ... to the rude people who have taken to literally pushing others on the sidewalks of Davos in order to get past them -- which has happened twice in two days for Playbook . And to those crowding others at security lines , pretending not to see them -- twice in one day for Playbook as well . These people clearly did n't get the memo that at Davos , everyone with a badge is supposed to be equal . ( Of course , no badge , no care . ) <p> THE PRICE IS RIGHT : If you want to create your own lounge space in the Belvedere Hotel , you can expect to pay $3 million and up for the week . The bare minimum for a Promenade shopfront is $150,000 , excluding the cost of any renovations . <p> BY THE NUMBERS : One Belvedere Hotel corporate occupant said they 'd experienced a 20-percent drop in attendance at their events in 2020 . That 's the good news : Fewer hangers-on via the hotel badge system means our source is happier with the quality of their guest list . <h> WHAT YOU ( MAY HAVE ) MISSED <p> Peek inside the mind of Jamie Dimon , the world 's most powerful banker , who told folks at the Equality Lounge Wednesday evening : " My mom was a women 's libber " ... " More than half of my direct reports are women " ... " Leaders should say ' hi ' to everyone at the table . " <p> The Mooch : " I am 100 percent traumatized " by being fired from the White House , Anthony Scaramucci admitted to Playbook 's own Rym Momtaz during a panel she was moderating Wednesday afternoon . <p> SPOTTED : The Mooch getting raked over the coals by WEF security for having so many hair products in his bag as he went through screening . <p> YOUR TIRED BONES : Palantir is n't satisfied with amazing free coffee -- it also had a masseuse at its Wednesday cocktail session .

If you 're a meat lover , you may want to pack your ham sandwich ( more on that a bit further down ) . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> MORE TRUMP : The U.S. president is holding a press conference . Watch here . <p> VDL TAKES THE STAGE : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had her big Davos moment this morning , and she used it to send the message that the " geopolitical " focus for her new EU Commission means a new emphasis on hard power . " Europe needs credible military capabilities and we have set up the building blocks of a European defense mechanism -- it is complementary to NATO and it is different , " she said . <p> Playbook reality check : It 's unclear how von der Leyen plans on bringing her home country along for the NATO/defense ride : Germany ( where she was defense minister ! ) constantly refuses to flex its muscle . <p> Stepping up : " To be more assertive in the world , we know we must step up in some fields , " von der Leyen said . She acknowledged the EU had at times been caught flat-footed in responding to geo-political conflicts -- and conceded that EU countries have at times been too divided on foreign policy , particularly on the conflict in Libya . " Libya shows the cost of division and hesitation , " she said , calling last weekend 's ceasefire talks in Berlin " an important step in the right direction , " and saying the " Commission will strongly support reconciliation and reconstruction . " <p> Quotable : " It takes very little power to break a fragile balance , but the true power lies in putting the pieces back together again , " the Commission president said . <p> Message to Brexit Britain : Von der Leyen also used the opportunity to send a pointed message to the U.K. government of Boris Johnson , who instructed his ministers ( with the exception of Chancellor Sajid Javid ) to skip Davos : On the coming negotiations on the Political Declaration which will define the U.K. 's future relationship with the EU , von der Leyen said that while " shared values " will continue to unite the two , London should remember that " there is a difference whether you are a member state or not a member state where access to the single market is concerned . " <p> The money quote : " If it is the U.K. 's choice to be more distant to the EU , then there will be more distance where the single market is concerned , " VDL said . Mic drop . <p> NO JUSTICE LIKE TAX JUSTICE : In his Davos speech this morning , Spanish PM Pedro S ? nchez identified reestablishing social justice as a key challenge for Spain and Europe . " We live in prosperous societies which nevertheless have alarming levels of poverty , " he said , adding that tax avoidance is mentioned too rarely . " Let us not fool ourselves , " he continued , " there can not be social justice without tax justice . " <p> Echoing that message : Spain 's Deputy PM Nadia Calvi ? o , in an interview with CNBC . <p> GREEN PRINCE : Look out for the keynote speech from Prince Charles this afternoon at 2:40 p.m . The prince of Wales is a lifelong environmentalist , a philosophy he has put into practice throughout his Duchy of Cornwall ( which also happens to fund part of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's lives , but we do n't expect he will touch on that today ) . <h> THAT 'S AWKWARD <p> GROWING PAINS : It 's not every day that one gets to witness an intense exchange between the head honcho of the European Commission and their White House counterpart , but that 's the beauty of Davos , is n't it ? On Tuesday , Ursula von der Leyen had her first bilateral meeting with Trump since becoming Commission president -- an important moment for the new , geopolitical European Commission . But alas , there were no EU-side journalists there to see it . <p> He said , she said : The White House accused Commission staffers of failing to send the names of the journalists they wanted in the room to the U.S. team in advance ; Team VDL said they 'd never been asked to do so . But despite the fact WEF journalists undergo multiple levels of security screening , the White House would n't budge on its protocol . <h> TAXING TECH <p> TRUMP HUDDLES WITH TECH EXECS : Donald Trump had breakfast today with business leaders and tech executives including Apple CEO Tim Cook , Microsoft boss Satya Nadella and Salesforce chief Marc Benioff . Also in attendance : White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump , Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow , and the U.S. secretaries of labor , transportation , commerce and treasury . <p> THE BACKDROP : The tech industry has a lot to celebrate after the Trump administration reached an agreement with France to pause plans for a digital services tax on U.S. giants including Facebook and Google , while the two sides and the OECD try to hammer out a longer term deal . ( The deal underscores how the industry continues to rack up major policy victories in Washington on trade , taxes and more . Bjarke Smith-Meyer has more on this . ) <p> QUOTABLE : " Trade truce is not the same as trade peace -- trade peace is what we should be aiming for , " said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on a panel this morning . <p> WHAT ABOUT THE BRITS ? Mnuchin was on a panel alongside U.K. Chancellor Sajid Javid this morning . Asked about Britain 's own planned digital tax , he said : " We will be having some private conversations ... and I am sure the president Trump and Boris Johnson will be talking on it as well , as the president did with President Macron . " He added ominously : " We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature . If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies , we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies . " <p> The Saj unrattled : " We plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April , " Javid said , adding that it would be " proportionate " and " temporary , " and " it will fall away once there is an international solution . " <p> In conclusion : " We all agree that something needs to happen and it should be done in an international way , " Mnuchin said . " This year could be that year of change . " <h> MORE TECH ( BECAUSE IN DAVOS YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH ) <p> DID MBS HACK BEZOS ? A bombshell revelation overnight from the Guardian , and it 's a Davos trifecta : Saudi Arabia ( which will host the G20 this year and is out in force in Davos ) , Big Tech and a billionaire . " The Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone ' hacked ' in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia , " according to the Guardian . " The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world 's richest man , according to the results of a digital forensic analysis ... Large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos ' phone within hours . " Yikes . Perhaps a good conversation-starter over at the Saudi caf ? ? <p> 5G DINNER : Playbook 's Ryan Heath hosted a 5G-themed dinner Tuesday night ( under Chatham House rules ) , which generated passionate views on the way forward for the transformative technology . There 's lots of work ahead to beat a possible urban/rural divide , and to communicate that 5G is likely to be about much more than faster networks , but a way to connect all things , with big security and privacy implications . People want 5G networks built by domestic or allied manufacturers -- a way forward on their trust concerns could be the virtualization of some parts of these networks . A POLITICO-Qualcomm survey across 12 markets will be published in the coming days . <p> PROTOCOL PREVIEW : Protocol , a new media company that will exclusively cover tech from POLITICO publisher Robert Allbritton , is hosting a pre-launch VIP breakfast on Thursday at Nasdaq 's space . The event features Protocol Editor-at-Large David Pierce , who 'll be chatting with analyst Benedict Evans on his tech predictions for 2020 . Registrations are closed and the guest list is packed with tech execs , so get there early to get a good seat . <h> WIDENING THE SCOPE <p> MINISTRY OF TRUTH UPDATES : WEF has launched a Davos Friends of Africa Growth Platform . The founding members are the presidents of Botswana and Ghana and the chairman of AngloGold Ashanti . The platform 's goal is to create 1 million jobs . <p> ON LGBTI RIGHTS : " I 'm the prime minister and I 'm also gay , " Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told Playbook . " I think if people are here , they are here because of their profession -- it 's not the gay prime minister who is going to meet with the gay CEO of Apple , but Tim Cook is going to meet Xavier Bettel , and both are gay . And that 's cool . " For more sign up to our Davos Confidential podcast . <p> LISTEN TO THE BIG D : There is much talk about diversity , and how to make the corporate world more inclusive . CEO of Solvay Ilham Kadri shared her vision with Playbook via this morning 's Davos Confidential podcast : " Diversity for us is not only gender , it 's nationalities , it 's ethnicity , background , orientation , it 's diversity of thoughts , it 's the big D and when you have it in the room , you need to listen to it . " <h> FIGHTING THE MAN ? <p> BATTLE FOR . ORG : Some of the world 's biggest NGOs gathered at 11:45 a.m. this morning at the WEF Congress Center to protest the proposed sale of the top-level . org domain to a private equity firm . They say the non-commercial part of the internet -- the digital home of NGOs , nonprofits and civil society -- must remain in the hands of a nonprofit . Internet Society owns . org and wants to sell it to create a billion-dollar endowment for itself and its mission to protect the open internet . Global internet governance body ICANN is mulling whether to intervene to stop the sale . <p> OVERHEARD : A Playbooker hears there may have been a Burning Man party in Davos last night . We 're confused -- is n't Burning Man supposed to be anti-The Man , and is n't Davos as The Man as can be ? If you were there , get in touch -- we promise not to out you . <h> DAVOS INSIDER <p> VEGGIE DAY : It 's vegetarian and **27;250;TOOLONG menu day in the Congress Hall today -- for those who have been quick and lucky enough to identify both when and where the elusive food gets served . It 's part of the WEF 's sustainability push . Ninety percent of the food served during the forum is seasonal . <p> FORGET WHAT SHE SAID : Playbook can confirm that Theresa May will be joining the " citizens of nowhere " ( as she famously described globalists ) in Davos this week , and has been booked ( for goodness knows how much cash ) to speak at a dinner PWC is hosting tonight for business people and their clients . " The earnings will be declared in the normal way , " a May aide said . As POLITICO London Playbook 's Jack Blanchard points out , the former British PM did always enjoy a good mountain walk . <p> PEAK DAVOS : Who said Davos was just about lining one 's pockets -- or growing one 's rolodex to line one 's pockets ? There were two sessions this morning to mend your tired , burned-out souls . If you had three hours to spare , the first , held atop a nearby mountain , promised to help you " learn how to add more joy to your life . " If you were pressed for time , there was a more-manageable 30-minute meditation session led by Davos regular Sadhguru . Playbook could n't get to either because we were getting in place to attend panels on geopolitics and climate policy -- no rest for the wicked . But if you are so inclined , Sadhguru is leading another morning meditation session at 8:15 a.m . Thursday morning . <p> OVERHEARD : " One of the questions on the entrance test my 10-year-old had to take was whether his father has ? 48,000 for yearly tuition . " Unclear which is more mind boggling , that a 10-year-old 's boarding school should cost this much , or that a 10-year-old should know how much his father makes . Playbook did n't ask whether there was a question about the offspring 's mother 's earnings . <p> $34,000 : Speaking of expensive offspring , that 's how much vehicles rented by the U.S. Secret Service to shuttle Ivanka Trump around Davos for two days is costing taxpayers . The total price tag for the entire presidential delegation is over $4 million , according to Quartz , twice as expensive as Donald Trump 's first visit to Davos in 2018 . Playbook spotted the first daughter walking in the Congress Hall , and very few VIPs have elicited a similar commotion . Chinese journalists armed with phone-cameras tailed her , while CNN 's Jim Acosta attempted a question about her father 's impeachment . She remained unflappably mute . <p> OH MAMA : To be fair to the Trumps , Davos is a pricey place . Playbook , for instance , had a schnitzel at the Hotel Schatzalp that cost an eye-watering 56 Swiss francs ( around ? 52 or $57 ) , with undercooked and over-cucumbered potatoes . We 've had better schnitzel for a quarter of the price in a neighborhood caf ? in Vienna . <p> BIG FASHION DOES DAVOS : It had to happen : The Vogue Nightcap at Davos House was hosted by supermodel ( and philanthropist and angel investor ) Natalia Vodianova and Conde Nast Publishing Director Vanessa Kingori . The weirdest part ? Wesley Snipes requested salsa music only during the nightcap . <p> SKI REPORT : The last snowfall was Sunday and the temperatures are climbing , but Playbook ran into some lucky early risers hitting the slopes as we made our way to the Conference Hall . Today expect a high of 6C and sunny skies . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : At Goldman Sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth .

Explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Welcome back to the Davos Playbook , arriving a little later than expected today , just like U.S. President Donald Trump did . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> It 's top billing day in Davos -- just in case the constant stream of landing helicopters had n't clued you in already . And the special brand of WEF schizophrenia continues today : Youth climate activists are headlining panels while the world leader who occasionally mocks them gets the opening address . And it 's not the only contradiction of this forum , but more on that further below . <p> WHAT TRUMP HAD TO SAY : The U.S. president 's long-awaited Davos speech ( so long awaited , the WEF folks had to rope in some Swiss tenors in traditional dress to sing for the grumbling crowd ) was practically a love-letter to his Chinese counterpart , Xi Jinping . " He 's for China , I 'm for the U.S. , but other than that , we love each other , " Trump said when he took to the stage , 20 minutes behind schedule . ( Playbook side note : Before you pop your corks , let 's wait for the rest of the U.S.-China trade deal to be hammered out . ) <p> Trump 's two Davos messages ... <p> 1 . Got trade nerves ? Get used to it . Trump reckons his war-strategy is on the money , describing the deals he 's been making with China , Mexico , Canada and Greenland as " a new model for the 21st century . " <p> 2 . Chill out on climate change : Addressing the Greta of it all , Trump cheerfully said : " This is not a time for pessimism , " adding that " fear and doubt is not a good process , " and calling on folks to " reject the perennial prophets of doom . " But the U.S. president did indicate he wants to protect nature -- or in his words , " the majesty of God " -- his way , by committing to joining the initiative to plant 1 trillion trees . <p> Speaking of which : Before Trump 's speech , teen climate activist Greta Thunberg kicked the day off with a reality check . " The climate and the environment are hot topics right now , " Thunberg said on a morning panel , " but pretty much nothing has been done . " ( It was such a hot ticket , a woman was overheard listening to the panel livestream while using the ladies ' room , our colleague Cristina Gonzales writes in to report . ) <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business .

Learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <p> Trump will be in town until Wednesday , and has a series of bilateral meetings scheduled , including with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen this afternoon . Also in that meeting : European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan and Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton . What could they possibly all be talking about ? <h> TECH CENTRAL <p> TAX TRUCE ? A European alliance is trying to get Trump on board with a joint approach for taxing digital giants . If that fails , Europe 's mountain musketeers are seeking to at least settle Trump 's current tax spat with France . Those efforts appear to be off to a good start , with French President Emmanuel Macron tweeting late Monday that he had an " excellent discussion " with Trump on the digital tax , and Trump echoing that sentiment . <p> After that pleasant exchange , reports of a truce : Macron has agreed to postpone France 's tech tax until the end of the year , Elisa Braun reports for POLITICO 's Technology , Financial Services and Trade Pros . The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump pledged to postpone retaliatory tariffs in return . French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is expected to meet with his U.S. counterpart Steve Mnuchin in Davos on Wednesday . Stay tuned for more . <p> AI 'S NOT AS SCARY AS THE BOMB : Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei tried to sound reassuring on a panel this morning ominously titled " Technology Arms Race , " ( though he asked for trouble by opening with comments about an " explosion " in artificial intelligence ) . It was touted by the Economist 's Zanny Minton Beddoes as " one of the hottest tickets in Davos " -- not to mention one of the most controversial . <p> The Huawei CEO recalled that when he was a child , " the biggest fear people had was atom bombs . But if we look at history from a distance , we see enormous benefits from atomic energy and radiation , for example in medicine . Today we see fears about artificial intelligence , but we should not exaggerate : AI is not as damaging as atom bombs . " That did n't convince fellow panelist Yuval Noah Harari , a historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . " The problem with AI in comparison with atomic weapons is that the danger is not so obvious , " he responded . " Everyone knows you ca n't win a nuclear war , but people do think you can win an AI arms race . That 's dangerous . " <p> POLITICO INTERVIEW : En route to Davos , Microsoft President Brad Smith swung by POLITICO 's office in Brussels . He said his company was prepared to help Europe control where and how its data is processed , amid intensifying debate over whether data should be stored in the bloc . " The default is rapidly becoming that European data should stay in Europe and be subject to European rules . We will adapt to that , " said Smith . " The real question is what 's the model for the use of data that will insure that value of the data accrues to these countries . " <h> WALKING THE WALK ... KINDA <p> GEOGRAPHY DOES N'T LIE : Climate and sustainability may be the talk of the town , but Playbook took a stroll along the Promenade and spotted the SDG tent quite a hike away -- an afterthought ? -- from the center of the action , where companies like Google , Facebook and Philip Morris International have set up shop . Not exactly the best way to convince people that sustainable change is at the heart of the discussions . <p> AND INVITATIONS DO N'T EITHER : Was historian Rutger Bregman not invited back to the WEF this year because he offended the rich and powerful last year ? That 's his take . At the 2019 forum , Bregman called out the hypocrisy of tax-minimizing billionaires flying into Davos aboard their private jets to decry climate change and inequality . <p> TROUVEZ LES FEMMES : We grilled the WEF Monday about the slow progress of increasing women 's participation at Davos . The forum responded by pledging to double female involvement by 2030 . <p> ' DOUBTS WELCOME ' : Philip Morris International is transitioning to " delivering a smoke-free future . " If that makes you raise an eyebrow , you are not the only one . The cigarette titan has a pop-up shop on the promenade where it 's pushing its " unsmoked " concept and inviting doubters to come inside and debate . Overheard at its party last night ( where attendees were serenaded by Sheryl Crow ) : " Nicotine is n't the problem , burning it is . " <p> SLEEPING IN THE SNOW -- DAVOS STYLE : Playbook 's Ryan Heath joined campaigners seeking to end homelessness in the snow last night , bunking down in a sleeping bag with some hay bales as a wind barrier against the -- 17-degree-centigrade weather . Having enjoyed the Davos high life , Ryan wanted to experience the rough end of extreme housing , inequality and weather . His takeaway : wind is the real enemy . <p> There 's a permanent risk of being discovered and told to move , and every footfall , car light or sudden movement is liable to wake you . Leaving the sleeping camp just before 6 a.m. also presented a whole new side of Davos : the supplier class made up of e-car drivers , safety officers , food vendors and others who are all up well before dawn making the WEF work for the 0.1 percent . <p> RAINBOW WAVE : Jin Xing , one of Monday night 's Crystal Award winners , is known as the Chinese Oprah , but most interestingly she gained fame and a devoted following by detailing her journey from male army colonel to female TV personality . That prominence is n't quite matched in the rest of the program , but this year there are three official WEF sessions on LGBTQ themes , including " Free to Be ( LGBTI ) " from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday at the Swiss Alpine High School Auditorium . GLAAD and the Ariadne Getty Foundation are going big on Thursday , including a dinner with Yo-Yo Ma . The goal : LGBTQ advocates want to send the message that WEF 's biggest partners want these issues elevated up Davos ' agenda . <p> DAVOS GOGGLES ? " Davos is the place where conflicts are averted , business is started , disputes are finished " -- so said Ursula von der Leyen in her Monday address . If you are scratching your head to come up with which conflicts were averted in Davos , you are not the only one . <h> REPORTS CORNER <p> SLUGGISH GROWTH : That 's the 2020 forecast by IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva , and one big underlying culprit is none other than trade wars . " Global growth remains sluggish ... adjusting to live with the new normal of higher uncertainty read : Trump ... the underlying causes for trade tension are still with us , " she said . But it 's not just trade : " Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East " and " the dramatic impact that climate shocks can have as seen recently in Australia and parts of Africa " are also factors . <p> Side note : Is n't it interesting how Australia gets a name-check , but African countries are lumped together ? <p> OH THE HYPOCRISY : A report by Greenpeace highlights that 24 banks which regularly attend the WEF have provided $1.4 trillion of financial support for the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement set new emissions reduction goals in 2015 . More in this write-up by the Guardian . <p> A PESSIMISTIC GLOBAL ELITE -- PWC GLOBAL CEO SURVEY : CEOs worldwide recorded a record level of pessimism in this year 's PWC survey of some 1,500 chief execs in 83 countries . That 's despite the fact that only two years ago , the 2018 CEO survey recorded a level of optimism never seen before when it comes to worldwide economic growth . <p> TOUGH TIMES FOR DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM : According to the Edelman Trust Barometer , 56 percent of respondents to a survey across 28 countries worldwide agreed that " capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world . " At Tuesday morning 's launch event , former Danish PM Helle Thorning Schmidt said " I am worried business will not do enough to support democracy . We need all the help we can get . " Microsoft president Brad Smith added : " Fix democracy first . We 'll find a way to do our business after that . " <h> DAVOS INSIDER <p> LUNCH MATTERS : Word to the wise : If you are not staying in one of the ( very few ) hotels do n't have a reservation , your chances of getting a proper warm meal are nil . Head to the nearest supermarket -- their cantines serve warm food all day . <p> BADGE HIERARCHY : This year , there are two levels of hotel badges ( and a very long line to pick them up , if you have n't already ) : " Strategic Partner Hotel Badges " -- all hotels , all days -- and " Regular , " which are for one day only . <p> GROW-HO-HO : Facebook 's own promotional magazine , Grow , is being stocked next to the Harvard Business Review , Arab News , FT and NY Times in the Belvedere Hotel lobby . Its cover is a " 50 over 50 " list of entrepreneurs ... they really have given up on the kids ! <p> RESPONSIBLE SWAG : Zurich at Promenade 84 has the usual blue beanies , plus coffee , tea and soup . New this year : For every beanie given away , Zurich will plant a tree . As of Monday night , they 'd given away 3,759 of them . <p> OTT : Some chalets are as tall as six storeys and come with teams of drivers , chefs and yoga instructors . A full-time Davos driver will set you back $10,000 for the week , if the amount one large consulting firm has paid up is any indication . Corporations are taking over not only shopfronts ( hence the dearth of lunch options ) but whole apartments above them and converting them into meeting and event spaces . Some , like Facebook , have erected temporary buildings that will disappear the week after Davos . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Because , at Goldman Sachs , they believe sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it is no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . As part of this push , Goldman Sachs is committed to helping clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets -- making sustainable finance a firmwide mandate , to achieve an inclusive , low-carbon economy . Learn more about Goldman Sachs ' newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Good day and welcome to Day 2 of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook . Today 's the soft launch ; on Tuesday , the serious business starts . Catch up on Sunday 's preview newsletter here . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> IN CASE YOU HAVE N'T NOTICED -- DAVOS IS GOING GREEN : It 's wall-to-wall sustainability this year ( private jets aside , cough cough ) . You ca n't escape climate exhortations on stage , on billboards , or even at the buffet line . Wednesday will be a meat-free day at the WEF . <p> SLUMMING IT : More photographic evidence that not everyone at Davos is living it up in the lap of luxury . Playbook is starting to wonder if there is n't some subliminal messaging going on with all these Twitter posts . <p> NOT SLALOMING IT : And even if you 've managed to get some more luxurious digs , there 's no rest up the mountain this year . Mondays at past WEFs might have included a leisurely day skiing or a late arrival for many participants , since not much happened before the official WEF opening on Monday evening . This year , agendas started filling up with a round of Sunday night welcome drinks , while this afternoon you can find side events on everything from cryptocurrencies to cannabis and CEOs . Then the Monday welcome drinks begin . <p> But Davos is not monopolizing summitry today ... <p> BRITISH PM BORIS JOHNSON IS BUSY with the inaugural U.K.-Africa Investment Summit , which will feature more than 20 of Africa 's 54 leaders , who are in London today . While that 's more than the African leadership contingent in Davos , it 's only around half the number of African leaders who turned up to Beijing and Moscow in recent months for similar summits . <p> SOME EUROPEAN POLITICS : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will have to ponder a tempting offer : Local paper Tages-Anzeiger reports that during a bilateral meeting today , Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga will offer additional financial help for the EU 's migration and climate change policies -- in exchange for more favorable conditions when it comes to the EU-Switzerland framework agreement , which has been in the works for ages . <p> MACRON IS CHOOSING FRANCE and gathering 200 French and foreign CEOs , for the third year in a row , in Versailles . Sunday evening , Macron announced ? 4 billion in new investments from companies like MSC , Coca-Cola andAstraZeneca . JPMorgan Chase announced plans to double its staff in Paris in coming years as it relocates some of its services from London after Brexit , though the U.K. capital will remain far ahead of Paris in terms of headcount . <p> MEANWHILE , Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is in Brussels today . He will meet with digital and competition chief Margrethe Vestager and Europe 's Green Deal Vice President Frans Timmermans . <p> Davos twofers : These CEO meets have one thing in common : They 're piggybacking on Davos , with more and more corporate and government leaders gathering in the fourth week of January . They either use Davos as the anchor for a meeting-packed Europe trip , or they use it as the hook to get people to their own events -- a kind of two-for-one deal behind the WEF 's back . <p> ' MAKE THE WORLD COOL AGAIN ' : If you see flowers and koala bears trekking through the snow en route from Landquart to Davos , do n't be alarmed ( unless you 're a climate offender ) : Climate activists dressed in costumes , holding banners that call for people to " ignore the Donalds and listen to the Gretas , " set off Sunday on the three-day , 40-kilometer ( 25 mile ) , frigid hike . <p> And they 've already left some traces along the way : You might see " NO PLANET B " in the snow on your way in today , as RTE 's Will Goodbody did . <h> THINGS TO PONDER <p> HAVE WE PEAKED ? Apparently some think we have reached the turning point on a host of the most important characteristics of the post-World War II Western world : globalization and capitalism . And as a result , we will be seeing more corporate responsibility given to stakeholders , with more concrete work to fight climate change and inequality . If it sounds a little familiar , that 's because we 've heard it before , but Playbook will keep an open mind throughout this week and look for signs of this momentous change . Bloomberg has a rundown of a few other areas in which the world has reportedly peaked . <p> THE NEW POWER-BROKERS : Most people did n't know what a CSO was several years ago ( it 's the chief security officer , for the record ) , but their rapid ascent continues . Ask around and you will soon realize they can have more power at their fingertips than CEOs , including the ability to shut down a company 's website or operations when under attack , without waiting for the CEO 's approval . Stay tuned for more over the coming days . <p> QUOTABLE : " Every company is now a tech company , it does n't matter what they sell , " says Brett Solomon , head of digital rights NGO Access Now . <p> WHY WEF IS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL : Do n't worry about fitting in , because everyone is as insecure as the next person in Davos . The truly important people feel weird because here they are just averagely important . The CEOs feel weird because officially they are below the national leaders in the pecking order , and ca n't escape that fact the way they do the other 51 weeks of the year . Ministers feel weird because no one recognizes them and they 're often separated from their minders . And everyone else feels like the plain person at Fashion Week . It 's perverted egalitarianism but it is , well , equalizing . <p> ... AND WHY EVERYONE COMES ANYWAY* : David Gelles for the New York Times writes that the forum has " become a punchline " but quotes Eurasia Group 's Ian Bremmer , saying " Six days of work at Davos is easily six months of work in other places " because of the intensity of private meetings among powerful people . <p> *Bill Gates is a notable absentee this year . " Bill 's schedule has shifted and he 's unable to attend Davos as planned , " his foundation said via email . <p> WHERE THERE 'S NO SMOKE , THERE 'S FIRE : Philip Morris , straining to pitch itself as more than a tobacco company ( an especially sensitive element in Davos , in light of the WEF 's ban on tobacco sponsorship ) , will be hosting a " Grand Opening " to rival the WEF 's official one , featuring a live performance by nine-time Grammy winner Sheryl Crow tonight at 6 p.m. at Promenade 63 . British artist Beverley Knight will close out the week with a live performance Thursday evening . <p> AUTO-SCHWAB -- AIRING TODAY : Filmmaker Marcus Vetter followed WEF founder Klaus Schwab for a whole year , and got very much behind the scenes . ARD airs the long-form documentary tonight ; here 's a link , and here 's where to find other language versions . <p> SUCCESSION ? Schwab sat down with CNBC for a rather odd , softball interview about his succession plans for WEF . Spoiler alert : He 's not planning on stepping down any time soon , he jokes about coming to the office with " more ideas than they can digest , " and he 's open to his son playing a large role after he 's gone ( Olivier Schwab is WEF 's head of business engagement . ) <p> -- Women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day -- a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year , which is more than three times the size of the global tech industry . <p> -- Getting the richest 1 percent to pay just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth over the next 10 years would equal the investment needed to create 117 million jobs in sectors such as elderly and childcare , education and health . <p> WEF 'S INAUGURAL SOCIAL MOBILITY REPORT : Top findings are that increasing social mobility , a key driver of income equality , by 10 percent would boost economic growth by nearly 5 percent over the next decade . The Top 10 countries in the Global Social Mobility Index are all European , the Top 5 all Scandinavian , while the five economies with the most to gain from boosting social mobility are China , the United States , India , Japan and Germany . Report here . <h> SWAG ALERT <p> -- Davos ' bottom feeders -- those with " hotel badges " -- have been excited to find a free one-day ski pass in their welcome kit . <p> -- Coffee wars : It 's not just Palantir and its sleek pavilion trying to swap coffee for your data this year . Facing off against the data giant are the Saudis , who are trying to woo your love and tourism interest in exchange for caffeine . Tata Consultancy is offering both coffee and tea in a literal face-off with the Saudis mid-Promenade . <p> Keep your eyes open and send your swag tips to davos@politico.eu . Last year 's best included free cashmere scarves from an American online university called WorldQuant . <h> TRUMP WATCH <p> MILESTONE : Today marks three years of Donald Trump 's U.S. presidency . His impeachment trial starts on Tuesday , along with his return ( diversion ? ) to Davos . For more on that , tune in to tomorrow 's edition . <h> APR ? S <p> I DAVOS , THEREFORE I WILL.I.AM : It seems rappers never die , they just go to Davos . The town 's perpetual celebrity will be speaking on inspiring young people and his AI company I.AM+ . <p> SKI REPORT : Today 's the coldest day of the week , so break out all your warmest gear : the high today will be -- 4C ( it 's a bitter -- 9 as Playbook hits your inboxes ) . There was a light snow dusting Sunday evening , but ski conditions are good . <p> TUNES : If any of this year 's attendees need a little encouragement on their transformational paths , David Bowie 's got some words for you . Go on , get those Changes in place . <p> SECURITY ! If you took the train up to Davos on Sunday , you probably saw groups of Swiss military coming in too . Do n't be alarmed , one young soldier told Playbook , they were just folks returning from their weekends away and deployments to secure the forum for the coming week . <p> TECH SNAFU : WEF participants were lining up round the corner for their badges at 11 p.m . Sunday night after first the registration center security scanners broke down , and then the computer network was blocked . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : At Goldman Sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth . The firm is committed to helping its clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets . They will achieve this vision by doing what they do best -- invest , finance , advise , and innovate -- to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies that accelerate positive change . That 's why Goldman Sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . Explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Good day and welcome to the 50th edition of the World Economic Forum -- and another year of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook , the essential daily guide to life on the world 's most elite mountain . <p> Here is the WEF center stage program , with notes on which sessions are livestreamed ( 224 will be online ) . <p> This month is also the centenary of the Treaty of Versailles going into effect , and entirely timely , as Great Power competition seems to be making a big comeback . Will this year 's forum help foster a regrouping of liberal democracies away from trade wars and toward more diplomatic cooperation on issues like Iran , proliferation , etc ? ( U.S. President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to meet here to talk tariffs . ) And will the fires in Australia finally light a fire under the bums of the powers that be to take meaningful climate action ? <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . That 's why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <h> TOP TOPIC -- CLIMATE CHANGE <p> GET ON THE GREEN TEAM OR GO HOME : Or that 's the stated goal at least . WEF is going all-in against climate change this year . With Australia reeling from catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged a huge chunk of its biodiversity , the theme could not be more relevant . Barely an hour will pass without a climate or broader sustainability session in the official program , never mind the extensive unofficial events and billboards that overtake the town . <p> WEF is also on its way to becoming climate activist Greta Thunberg 's amplifier-in-chief . The forum presents her ahead of Donald Trump and Angela Merkel in its list of high-profile speakers and reposts her articles , for example , including this Davos preview article in the Guardian , where Thunberg says : " Anything less than immediately ceasing these investments in the fossil fuel industry would be a betrayal of life itself . " <p> WEF 's alignment with Thunberg reflects many things , including the increasing concerns of WEF employees when it comes to the climate plans of companies and governments that WEF brings together year-round . " Heightened impatience " is how one polite Davos veteran staffer described the atmosphere to Playbook . Will peer pressure from all the discussions help CEOs and leaders put their money where their mouths are ? Stay tuned . <p> CONTEXT OUTSIDE THE SNOW GLOBE : Geopolitical crises are never too far in the background , though . There 's a highly anticipated conference on Libya underway in Berlin as this Playbook hits your inboxes . Protests over corruption and demanding more self-determination are still raging in Lebanon , Iraq and Iran . And the Iran nuclear deal standoff , with the triggering of the dispute resolution mechanism , casts an ever-longer shadow over any discussions about peace and security , even though Iran 's Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif pulled out of the forum this year . <p> Expect a more heated tone in some forum sessions this year : Some CEOs as well as WEF staffers are losing their patience . Ibrahim AlHusseini , an early Tesla and Uber investor who now heads investment firm FullCycle , told Playbook 's Ryan Heath that businesses need to be guided by " ecosystem supremacy . " His view is that while it 's progress for the U.S. Business Roundtable to join WEF in advocating stakeholder interests alongside shareholder interests , it 's not enough . <p> " Even financial winners have to breathe the air . They 'll have to drink water , " he said . " They still live in this closed sphere but there is nowhere else to go . So everything has to be factored in from now on . We have the science , we have the data . We have the proof . Technologies are ready . There is more than enough money sloshing around to fix this . There is no excuse to keep kicking the can forward . " <p> Look out for more " climate heroes " ( WEF 's words ) this week who are n't Greta . The teen category includes : Fionn Ferreira , who 's working to extract microplastics from water ; Melati Wijsen , who led a ban on plastic bags , straws and styrofoam in Bali ; and Autumn Peltier , the Anishinabek Nation 's 15-year-old chief water commissioner , in Canada . Adults include : Neel Tamhane , who leads a citizen tree-planting drive that 's put 9 billion trees in the ground in 27 cities in South Asia , and Jane Goodall , the primatologist who redefined the relationship between humans and animals <p> Half of economy dependent on nature : A new WEF analysis examining 163 industry sectors and their supply chains suggests " $44 trillion of economic value generation -- over half the world 's total GDP -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and , as a result , exposed to risks from nature loss . Construction ( $4 trillion ) , agriculture ( $2.5 trillion ) and food and beverages ( $1.4 trillion ) are the three largest industries that depend most on nature . " <h> GUEST GUIDE <p> DAVOS A VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS ? With every global conference now looking and feeling like Davos ( think Halifax Security Forum , Munich Security Forum , German Marshall Fund conferences , NATO Engages , Doha Forum ) : What is Davos anymore ? Decision-makers and experts seem to travel around a conference circuit tearing their hair out over populism on big white sofas arranged in semi-circles against blue backdrops . Then there are competitors who borrow liberally from the WEF format , such as Concordia Summit . And to top it off : there 's more programming outside the Congress Center than inside it , putting pressure on the WEF business model . The WEF 's success is making it a victim of global elite hyperinflation . <p> Cherchez les femmes : Gender parity has n't reached the Davos summit yet . There are 2,800 participants from more than 118 countries , according to the WEF , and yet only 24 percent are women . Some might say that 's progress ( the WEF has been stuck at around 20 percent female participation for many years ) , but still not enough . WEF points out that this is more than the 21 percent share of ministerial posts women hold worldwide , and well above the ratio of female CEOs globally . <p> The radical new choice : Just stay home . More often than not , WEF press releases herald a record number of leaders and CEOs and ministers heading to Davos . This year the numbers are impressive -- but flat : around 280 senior public leaders , including more than 50 national leaders . For corporate denizens of Davos , quite a few among Playbook 's contacts are skipping this year 's event with a shrug . <p> A more radical choice ? A co-creator of Occupy Wall Street attending . " Rejecting Davos is easy when one has not been invited to attend , " Micah White writes . So he 's coming and committing " reputational suicide " -- it 's all very dramatic , but in a constructive way . " What I discovered is that Davos is not one thing . There are many Davoses at Davos . And it is possible to reject one or more sides of the gathering while still finding revolutionary potential in another aspect of it , " White said . We 'll have to check in with him at the end to see how many of his goals he managed to achieve . <p> WHO 'S NOT : French President Emmanuel Macron , ever the disrupter , is still staying away -- but not without having his own mini French Davos , called Choose France ( cheekily taking advantage of CEOs coming to Davos to make a stop in Paris first and discover all the ways Macron says his reforms have improved the investment environment . At least that 's the Elys ? e 's pitch ) . Macron also heads on Tuesday to Israel and the Palestinian territories . He 'll be attending the 75th commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz . <p> This year Boris Johnson has gone as far as to ban his ministers from attending -- except for Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid . The U.S. Congress delegation will be relatively small , thanks to the Democratic primary and impeachment process . <p> EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell was vocal about his non-attendance : " In Europe , everybody is rushing to Davos , but I think it is more important to be here , " Borrell said at the Raisina Dialogue on global governance in New Delhi . ( A good handful of his fellow EU commissioners are actually going to Davos . ) <p> It 's a kind of " Back to the Future " exercise , given that Klaus Schwab -- the Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF -- has always advocated long-term sustainable capitalism ( see his original 1973 Davos Manifesto ) . And yet , it 's inescapable that in providing a platform for engagement with all manner of CEOs and controversial regimes , Davos is n't just a place of consensus and dialogue -- it 's also a platform used by those leaders for reputational airbrushing . That leads Playbook to ask : Is Davos one of the reasons we need a new type of capitalism ? <p> ' CEO disease ' : Perhaps another incentive for a new type of capitalism might be selfish ? The coterie of the world 's most powerful and wealthiest will be told this week , by Dr. Marta Ra of Paracelsus Recovery , a leading psychiatric treatment center in London , that the very traits that make exceptional senior executives -- tenacity , resilience , risk-taking -- are also linked to addiction , depression and anxiety . The clinic has identified a 500 percent increase in referrals of CEOs in the last seven years , with bipolar disorder becoming increasingly prevalent , according to the Telegraph . And the WEF is devoting several sessions this year to mental health . After all , the clinics in Davos that a century ago treated tuberculosis , as made famous in a certain Thomas Mann novel , are now treating burnout and depression . <h> DAVOS ESSENTIALS <p> CHECK YOUR RESERVATION ... if you 're booked at Hotel B ? nda : The establishment changed management in November . But the previous one had already sold rooms for WEF week , Blick newspaper reported . And many of those affected will first find out when trying to check in : " When we first came to the hotel , the servers were empty , " the new manager told the paper . " We could not find out who had already booked and paid for rooms . That 's why we could n't get in touch with the people concerned . " Seems you 're safe and will get a room if you 've made a reservation via the WEF 's own service provider . <p> Street sleeping in Davos : If Hotel B ? nda guests find themselves homeless , they wo n't be the only ones sleeping on the streets . Despite the below-freezing temperatures ( more like -15 Celsius or 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) , Homeless Entrepreneur , an NGO that campaigns to help the homeless use and gain skills to build new lives , will have its activists sleeping out on the streets starting Monday . The contrast between the private jets of the WEF set and those in their sleeping bags will be stark . Playbook 's Ryan Heath will be joining them , more in Tuesday 's Playbook . <p> Somewhere in between : Not everyone stays in hotels when attending Davos , or on the street . In fact , many stay in apartments in town or a trek away . And it 's not exactly fancy-ville . Behold WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck 's " glamorous " digs . <p> PRO TIP -- DRESS CODE : You 're spending a week on a mountain . Besides the obvious need for sensible snow shoes , make sure you wear layers and make at least one other concession to your setting . Maybe it 's a sweater , a jacket with a faux-fur-lined hood , or some statement boots . Whatever you do , do n't storm around the mountain in a suit alone . It does n't impress anyone : it makes you look like a tone-deaf first-timer . <p> SKI REPORT : It 's expected to be sunny and chilly Monday . Higher up , on the ski slopes , expect a frigid -15 Celsius . It snowed all morning Sunday , with low visibility at times . The pavements are slushy rather than icy across Davos town . <p> STUCK IN KLOSTERS ? If you 're not staying in Davos itself , you 're either VVIP and paying for privacy , or you booked late or are on a budget . Never fear : try the Chesa Grischuna , an old haunt of Hollywood stars and royals . If a 25-minute train ride schedule is n't convenient , the WEF shuttle leaves from Piz Buin and opposite the train station from 6 a.m. each morning , and runs until midnight ( 2.5 hours longer than the trains run ) . <h> ACTIVITY GUIDE <p> HOTTEST TICKETS : We 'll keep you up to date each morning , but we 're willing to bet Priyanka Chopra Jonas will have an edge in grabbing attention when she urges leaders to end extreme poverty . If you want to join her Tuesday , you can sign up for the " Reimagining the World 's Biggest Challenges " lunch ( hosted by Global Citizen and Teneo ) here . <p> THE PARTY WARS : Cloudflare saw the gap left by Google giving up on their annual Davos party and zoomed right into it last year . They were determined to win the crown of best Davos closing party from Salesforce ( many say they succeeded ) , and this year they 've co-opted Hotel Europe 's karaoke piano bar legend Barry , and set him up as the social sub-brand of Cloudflare Haus , at Promenade 37 . On Thursday night , Jason Derulo will top the Cloudflare party bill . <p> Freuds ' Davos House will once again be the nightcap venue of choice each night . The PR agency runs Sustainable Development Goals-themed programming until the bubbles and cocktails flow . The question on everyone 's lips : After bringing over five-star sushi chefs from London in 2019 , what will they do to whet appetites this year ? <p> If you ca n't make it across the river to Davos House , try Davos Cannabis House -- for market research only , of course . This important emerging market can be found at Promenade 69 . <p> TUNES : Davos veterans know there 's never a shortage of records spinning . So this year we 'll have Playbook Songs for the Day . Send us the song that 'll be playing between your ears this week . In the spirit of this year 's theme , let 's kick it off with two songs , one for the stakeholders , all of them , including the Salt of The Earth , and one for the climate -- because what is a Green Davos without snow ? Special thanks to Bruno Tertrais , deputy director of the Fondation pour la Recherche Strat ? gique , for the suggestions . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth .

Safe travels back home everybody , and see you all up on the mountain again next year . If you liked what you read and heard here this week , subscribe to Florian 's Brussels Playbook and tune in to Ryan 's EU Confidential podcast for more . <p> " Foreboding about the future was a prevailing theme at this year 's Davos , sometimes even with a dash of dystopian prophecy , " according to John . " This brooding was accompanied often , in speeches and interviews , by a rueful acknowledgment that government leaders are desperately improvising -- often with bleak results -- to meet the political crises of the moment , much less the long-term technological and climatological challenges of the age . " <p> The big challenges ? " In key Western capitals , governance is failing . China is exploiting . Global temperatures are rising . Tech titans are groveling . Prospects for economic downturn are rumbling . Little wonder that , instead of triumphant optimism about the forces of globalization sometimes associated with Davos , some voices here made it sound like modern life is on a toboggan ride to hell . " Read on here . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future . Learn more here. ** <p> THURSDAY 'S PARTY WARS REPORT : Cloudflare lit up the Strip -- um , Promenade -- with Ellie Goulding , in acoustic , a bold challenge to other companies either afraid to host lavish parties in Davos these days or stuck hiring stars from past eras ( a dig at Salesforce who brought Sting to Davos , but forgot to invite Playbook , though we crossed Sting 's path at Davos House in the wee hours ) . Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince made a point of saying the company wants to highlight a new generation of leaders . Case in point : They brought two survivors of the Parkland school shooting on stage . <p> Meanwhile , Jack Ma and Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang hosted an art gallery dinner Wednesday with performers from all over China ( including Jack who did a magic show ) and Ma 's chefs from Hangzhou . Among the guests : Jordan 's Queen Rania and her son Crown Prince Hussein ; Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ; the king and queen of Belgium ; Paul Kagame of Rwanda ; Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg ; IMF chief Christine Lagarde ; and CEOs James Quincey of Coca Cola , Carlos Brito of AB InBev , Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone and David Taylor of P&amp;G . <p> THE FACTS ABOUT FACEBOOK : Mark Zuckerberg penned a defense of his company , published in the Wall Street Journal , in which he insists users are in control of how their data is used . <h> MOUNTAIN ORACLE <p> GEORGE SOROS ATTACKS CHINA : Artificial Intelligence can do a great deal of harm to societies when in the wrong hands , the Hungarian-American philanthropist slash investor said over dinner Thursday . And by wrong , he meant Chinese . " China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest , strongest and technologically most advanced , " said Soros . " This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies . " <p> Soros , as always , had strong opinions and harsh words for the enemies of open societies , his erstwhile opponents . And , as every so often , he was the one on Thursday to encapsulate the general consensus on the biggest issue at Davos week . And yet , there was no word on Hungary , or its prime minister , Viktor Orb ? n -- perhaps , at 88 , he 's come to think there are bigger fish to fry . <p> Call to action : " Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly , the U.S. needs to crack down on them . If these companies came to dominate the 5G market , they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world . " <h> DAVOS PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW <p> HUGE THREAT , CREDIBLE ANSWERS : NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Alliance will come up with " credible deterrence and defense " should Russia continue to breach the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty , the agreement that since 1988 has banned all land-based missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers . " We have asked all our military authorities , our commanders to look into different options and consequences , " Stoltenberg told Playbook in an interview in Davos Thursday , adding that NATO " will make a measured , proportionate and defensive decision . " <p> IT 'S SERIOUS ... " The INF treaty has been for 30 years the cornerstone of arms control . The treaty not only reduced the number of missiles but actually banned a whole category , " Stoltenberg said , referring to intermediate-range weapons . <p> Russia , he went on , " has developed and is deploying new missiles " that are " mobile , hard to detect , nuclear capable " and can reach European cities " with little warning time . " That also means the threshold for any use of nuclear weapons in a conflict is " reduced , " he said . <p> ... AND DANGEROUS FOR EUROPE : The collapse of the INF treaty most immediately creates grave new risks for Europe , especially because Russia already has its new missiles in place and any response by the West would likely hinge on the U.S. deploying new weapons on the Continent . Given transatlantic tensions , it 's far from clear that protecting Europe is high on U.S. President Donald Trump 's list of priorities . <p> DIPLOMACY FIRST : NATO ambassadors will meet with Russia today in a special NATO-Russia council , the main purpose of which , according to Stoltenberg , " is to discuss the INF treaty and for NATO allies to be able to call on Russia to come back into compliance of the treaty in a verifiable and transparent way . " Stoltenberg said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov will attend . <p> Reminder : Russia insists its new missile is not in breach of the obligations stemming from the treaty . The U.S. , dismissing those claims , has threatened to pull out of the treaty starting February 2 if Russia does not back down . <p> The bottom line : NATO has to prepare for " a world without the INF treaty , " according to Stoltenberg . Playbook 's translation : At the moment , there 's still no Plan B. <h> BREXIT ENTERTAINMENT <p> AKK ON FIRST FOREIGN MISSION : Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer , the new leader of Germany 's Christian Democratic Union , may have been in Chancellor Angela Merkel 's shadow on her trip to Davos -- and was not to be found on the official program -- but , well , Merkel did leave her a few issues to tackle , including Brexit . <p> " It is not clear what the U.K. wants , " Kramp-Karrenbauer told Bloomberg . " Once we have Brexit , there will be a European border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and we will need to have an agreement which has some kind of backstop . " <p> VARADKAR 'S ALLEGIANCES : " Ireland has obligations to protect the single market , " Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said during a Davos panel debate . " The United Kingdom would have a responsibility to abide by World Trade Organization rules , and both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honor the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process . " <p> What would happen in case of no deal ? " So I think we 'd end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland and the U.K. would have to come together and in order to honor our commitment to the people of Ireland that there would be no hard border , we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and regulations . " <p> Is there a Brit in the room ? The audience would have loved to hear U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond 's view -- alas , he pulled out of the panel discussion at the last minute . <p> ' No deal wo n't work ' : In the coatroom line outside the British business lunch at Davos ' Belvedere Hotel , Ryan overheard a senior British finance executive say to another U.K. executive : " I just saw Liam Fox and I lost the plot completely . I said you 've got to get out of your fact-free fantasy world . You know no deal wo n't work . We all know no deal wo n't work . " <h> QUEER DAVOS PEEKS THROUGH <p> Given the number of participating governments that , let 's face it , have little interest in promoting LGBT rights , it 's perhaps not surprising that LGBT issues have never really become part of the mainstream conversation here . <p> That 's shifted a little in recent years , thanks to organizations like Open for Business , GLAAD , HubCulture Pavilion , and the Ariadne Getty Foundation , which host unofficial events in hotels around town . But " there 's a lot more work to be done here , " said GLAAD director Sarah Kate Ellis . <p> In the spotlight : Tim Cook , the world 's most prominent openly gay CEO , joined the Davos event this year . And not without controversy . While Apple is usually invisible here , Cook chose to surface for dinner with Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's homophobic far-right president . <p> Where to next ? At this year 's LGBTQ lunch panel , the focus was " global acceptance . " " It 's about how we treat each other , " said Jim Fetterling , CEO of Dow . " It 's about staying the room " not simply protesting problem laws , leaders and company policies , he said . <p> Did you know ? Deutsche Bank has a self-described " head gay . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> REVELATION OF 2019 : Brown is the new white . Some of the cooler ( or more unusual -- shout out to you , hat girl ) people , events and parties take place beyond the official WEF space and its supposedly status-conferring white badges . To live the Davos experience these days , all you need is brown-colored plastic -- the so-called hotel badge -- and the kind of entrepreneurialism and energy sometimes harder to find behind the security check . <p> PLAY DATE : When was the last time you played ? At the Real Play Coalition luncheon Thursday , guests played games with the CEOs of IKEA and Lego Foundation , both founding members of the Coalition , alongside Unilever and National Geographic . UNICEF also announced it will be joining the coalition as a co-chair . The group , which included private sector leaders , NGOs , philanthropists and heads of international organizations , discussed the so-called " play gap " and the significance of the erosion of playtime for children around the world . <p> FRIDAY TRADITION REVIVED : The WEF 's Farewell Party at Schatzalp , canceled for years , is now back on the agenda in the form of a mountain lunch today at 1 p.m . <p> FAVORITE QUIP : WEF 's most fashionable attendee -- British fashion designer Ozwald Boateng -- was overhead at Davos House saying he was going to " have a quick Snoop Dogg around . " <p> DAVOS ON THE DNIPRO : Kiev 's rambunctious political scene moved to the Alps . Barely two months before the Ukrainian presidential election , three of the leading candidates -- President Petro Poroshenko ; the unpopular incumbent , opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko ; and Anatoly Hrytsenko , a former defense minister -- traded potshots in separate appearances across Davos Thursday . Poroshenko compared Tymoshenko to the current Venezuelan populist strongman , and she returned the insult . Speaking to Playbook , Hrytsenko said the incumbent needed to hold on to power to stay out of jail , accusing him of corruption . The trio were here , officially , to engage with the world 's politics and business elites and build support for Ukraine , which is entering a sixth year of a hot conflict with Russia . <p> SARDINE CITY : Dutch taxpayers should be proud : The Dutch government is squeezing in up to eight staffers to a room at their hotel in the town of Klosters , itself a cheaper alternative close to Davos . <p> POLITICO PODCAST : In our final daily Davos Confidential , Ryan talks to Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra about Brexit , what worries him about the EU and why people should vote in May 's European Parliament election . Ryan also speaks to GLAAD chief Sarah Kate Ellis . Listen in here . <p> THE NEXT BIG THING : The value of electronic waste produced each year is $62 billion -- three times the value of all silver produced each year . Check out the WEF report here . Will e-waste the next big thing ? After all , Davos was key to creating momentum for the ban of single-use plastics , by now one of the EU 's cornerstone policies . Stick with us and we 'll get back to you on that . See you next year ! <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future . We have invested more than $4.5 billion in research and development to provide adult smokers with better options to continued smoking . Behind this investment , and behind every advancement at Philip Morris International , is robust science .

If , on the other hand , you think Facebook has made a few mistakes that can be fixed with reforms here and there , Sandberg laid out a decent case Wednesday of how the company is changing ( without explaining how internal culture change is being implemented ) , and that Facebook does more good than bad . That Sandberg felt the need to address the idea of a government banning the tech giant 's business model and business practices , illustrates how rattled Facebook is by recent scandals . That said , Facebook and Sandberg show no sign of going anywhere . <p> SANDBERG 'S LIVE DIE ZEIT INTERVIEW : Sandberg was introduced as a role model and fighter and got a hug from her interviewer , Die Zeit 's Uwe Heuser , when the session ended . The Facebook COO moved quickly into gentle confession mode , saying the tech giant had n't " anticipated all the risks " of its monumental growth , nor " done a good job of explaining " how it handles user data . A recurring theme in Sandberg 's remarks was that the good outweighs the bad at the company , and that the current leadership is best placed to correct its own mistakes . In a move designed to re-orient Facebook to a more regulation-friendly stance , Sandberg said " we 're in a fundamental phase of rewriting the rules about tech . " <p> When Heuser asked why Instagram and WhatsApp chiefs had left the broader Facebook empire , all Sandberg could manage in reply was that she 's proud of how well the company is " sticking together " after a year of scandal . Can Mark Zuckerberg stay on as CEO/chairman supremo ? " I think he should , " she said . <p> Asked why so much data tracking is necessary , Sandberg said Facebook will roll out a " clear history " function on the site to help users minimize it . She rejected the idea of a subscription model though , because it would mean " most people ca n't afford to use it . " <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future . Learn more here. ** <p> RATING SANDBERG 'S SPEECH : out of five pandas . Sandberg took pointed questions on the chin , issued some soft mea culpas the audience wanted to hear , but successfully defended the core Facebook vision . After her remarks , and after initially leaving the stage , Sandberg bounced back up to literally lean in and strike up a conversation with a female audience member who was wearing a daring blue fur hat . The cameras went wild . It was a deft but slightly too perfect political moment . <p> SANDBERG PART II -- INSIDE HER OFF-RECORD RECEPTION FOR MEDIA : Playbook was invited but unable to attend the off-the-record session . Perhaps the most noteworthy observation from those who did attend : It mirrored the comments Sandberg had given on the record just 90 minutes earlier . <h> TODAY 'S HOT TICKETS <p> IT 'S GEORGE SOROS DAY . The billionaire slammed Facebook at his 2018 annual dinner . Who 'll be the punching bag this year ? Rumor has it he may go after China . <p> HIGH POLITICS : Anthony Scaramucci and Ehud Barak will be in conversation at 3.30 p.m. up the mountain at Canada Cannabis House . ( Israel is a huge medical cannabis center . ) <p> ALSO REST OF THE WORLD DAY : It says something about the lack of newsworthiness of many Davos speeches that we 're as excited about Soros and cannabis as the combined list of Asia , Middle East and African leaders speaking today . Still , here are the other highlights ... <p> At 5:30 p.m . President of South Africa Cyril M. Ramaphosa and President of Rwanda Paul Kagame will discuss African leadership . <p> Today the pro-LGBT forces of Davos ( generally sparse and low-key ) are gathering for lunch with GLAAD . The most interesting prominent gay Davos-goer is Apple CEO Tim Cook . The company is usually invisible here at WEF , so it 's interesting that Cook has chosen to surface this year , including for these dinner photos with Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's homophobic far-right president . <p> TONIGHT IS BANKERS ' NIGHT : JP Morgan ( Kirchner Museum ) and Citi ( Belvedere ) hold their receptions with their CEOs tonight , in the dinner window . Bank of America hosts its CEO nightcap at the Belvedere from 10:30 p.m . Ellie Goulding may steal the show , however , at the Cloudflare nightcap . <h> HIGHLIGHTS TOUR <p> MIRACLE ON THE MOUNTAIN : At a dinner hosted by AARP , the first six speakers were women . <p> SPOTLIGHT ON AGEING : At the AARP dinner , which looked at how to achieve more age diversity within organizations and across the workforce , someone noted there were 17 gender sessions at the WEF , but only two on age . Guests at the dinner urged a reframing of workers as " experienced " rather than old . The clear call to action : Interested organizations should work on writing the business case for hiring experienced/older workers . <p> RAJ SHAH OF THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION : The Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard announced a $50-million investment to accelerate the use of data science by non-profit , civic and government organizations -- the kind of " collaborative philanthropy platforms " the foundation considers its hallmark . Full details here . In a similar vein Co-Impact , a global collaborative of Rockefeller , the Gates Foundation , Skoll , Chandler and the Nilekani family that is focused on improving health , education and economic opportunity , announced $80 million in grants aimed at improving the lives of 9 million people in Africa , South Asia and Latin America . <p> " We really believe in science-based , partner-based efforts that can lift up the lives of millions . Science is how we solve problems , partners is how we get scale , " foundation chief Raj Shah told POLITICO . " That marriage of capabilities is why we get so excited about partnerships . " And that 's more needed now than ever : " Populist energy has caused people to pull back their commitments to help each other out , " -- but private philanthropy is " not a substitute for real American , global , and public leadership , " Shah said . <p> PERSPECTIVE FROM A DAVOS VETERAN : Anna Tunkel , APCO Worldwide 's head of strategic initiatives , started coming to Davos 12 years ago -- before the age of Promenade pop-ups and when daily events outside the Congress Center could be counted on two hands . She told Playbook that this year there are over 100 corporate lounges and pop-ups , and they 're looking quite representative of the changing global order . In other words , the conversation is spilling outside of the Congress Center , it 's much bigger than the WEF can control ( to its dismay ) , and the brands doing the best in their positioning tend to come from China , emerging markets and tech . This year there 's " a Chinese perspective almost on every panel : from future to consumption to trade , techno nationalism and future of global leadership , " Tunkel said . <h> SPEECHES RATED <p> ANGELA MERKEL : . The German chancellor gave the standard multilateral pep talk and said populism leads to misery . Not much charisma or surprise , but that 's very on-brand for Merkel . She went on to join a WEF-organized dinner . <p> SHINZO ABE : and a half pandas . It was all optimism and success and structural reform in the Japanese PM 's speech , despite the country 's ageing and shrinking population . What a reliable multilaterialist . The WEF almost peed its pants in excitement , proclaiming : " PM Shinzo Abe Heralds New Era for Japan as Policies Bear Fruit . " Abe ticked the gender box with " womenomics , " said he was narrowing economic gaps ( equality-ish ! ) , and now we 've got another damn catchphrase to throw in the bin in disgust : " Society 5.0 " -- one premised on borderless data . <p> CONTE , EXPLAINING HIMSELF : Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , in his address , defended his government 's plans from presumed criticism by saying that everyone else has got it wrong . " For too many years , Italian and European politicians have got the sequencing wrong ... in the past they have asked people to make sacrifices in the name of a more sparkling future ... fearing state failure , they have asked people to tolerate market failures . Citizens are now aware that sacrifices have resulted in a much worse society , " Conte said . Italians believed the EU was the solution to their problems , Conte said , but " reality turned out to be very different instead . " And so , " everyone with a few exceptions senses that tomorrow will be worse than today . " <p> Here 's the kicker : " My government is the institutional answer to the wish of the Italian people of finding a way forward , " Conte said . <p> EUROPE 'S GOT TALENT : Davos Playbook 's Florian Eder had lunch with a very interesting high-level bunch of people ( under Chatham House rules ) Wednesday . They 're thinking hard about how to make Europe more than a self-appraised champion in privacy and data protection -- but at the same time , to make sure the next big thing in tech is European . ( Here 's an accompanying WEF report on the matter . ) The mood at lunch was upbeat , the consensus : Europe is a great place to live and work . <p> It 's a European affair : " We just need to get a few things right , " Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira told Playbook , citing " collaboration across countries , making sure that funding is appropriate to process that -- and in that way we 'll do another favor to Europe , making sure that every citizen around Europe has an opportunity to thrive in the new economy . " <p> Make the beauties of Europe known : " If I had to make my decision today , I would n't move to the U.S. , " said one participant , calling for the EU to make it known to masters and PhD students from India that they 're welcome on the Continent ( and to change immigration laws accordingly ) . <p> Small can be beautiful : " Europe is n't made for scale , " said another lunch-mate . But that does n't have to be a disadvantage , should the next tech wave not produce consumer-based platforms but solutions for businesses . French-American entrepreneur Hicham Sabir , who was at the lunch , said afterwards : " I think Europe 's strength is in the small and medium enterprises , it 's in the innovation position it already has . " What 's missing ? " A framework to help those companies . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> PUTTING HEART INTO DAVOS : Kiwi PM Jacinda Ardern 's top message : " Be kind " to people . Elisha London , CEO of United for Global Mental Health , gave her a " Be Kind " Badge from Cynthia Germanotta , Lady Gaga 's mother and co-founder of the Born This Way Foundation . <p> MCKINSEY NEWS DESERT : Journalists were not welcome at the McKinsey party Wednesday . <p> SPOTTED : Belgium 's Queen Matilde walking the Promenade after lunch Wednesday . The Netherlands ' Queen M ? xima at Davos House , along with the Crown Prince Haakon of Norway . " House of Cards " actress Robin Wright and Bono deep in conversation in Davos House . Likewise , Britain 's former Foreign Secretary David Miliband with Former Chancellor George Osborne . Matt Damon at a Co-impact collaborative fund breakfast on United Nations sustainable development goals . <p> NO THANKS ! For Swisscom 's terrible mobile Wi-Fi routers and network . Playbook has two and they 're both useless . <p> DAVOS ' BLACK TIE ARABIAN NIGHTS PARTY REVIEW : Let 's start with the positive : It was the most diverse , large crowd Playbook has seen at seven WEFs . On the other hand , the place felt like a wooden chalet version of a sardine can . Plenty of people wore sweaters rather than black tie . The place was lit red , and many in the audience seemed to have gone with red outfits too . Queen Diambi of the Democratic Republic of Congo had to beg the crowd to shut up during her remarks . <p> ACCESS + ABILITY : Steep slopes and ice do n't make Davos the most accessible place , but the Smithsonian 's ACCESS + ABILITY exhibit is raising awareness about the benefits of universal design , even in towns like this one . From the Nike FLYEASE shoes -- designed in collaboration with a teenager with cerebral palsy -- to the " soundshirt " that enables the hearing-impaired to appreciate an orchestra . Spotted : Will.i.am modeling the soundshirt . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future .

Thorning-Schmidt headlined POLITICO 's cocktail party at Schatzalp last night ( see a 360-degree photo here from Twiplomacy 's Matthias L ? fkens ) , where 100 or so folk put their status-envy aside to mix across the badge classes and drink , debate and slide headfirst down the mountain . <p> GOOD MORNING from a chilly Davos . Pro Tip : Few activities will produce the pure joy of Schatzalp . We look forward to welcoming you to next year 's POLITICO Sled Run . Pics from last night here , here and here . <p> Fireworks : Our interview with Thorning-Schmidt is worth a listen -- she tears strips off Theresa May and her approach to Brexit , explains the critical value of supporting children raised in conflict and its aftermath , and says it 's time for a woman to hold one of the EU 's presidential positions . She 's also a fan of Michel Barnier , the EU Brexit negotiator , who many consider a top contender for European Commission president . It 's not hard to see the pair working well together . <h> TRENDING IN DAVOS <p> WHAT WE 'RE HEARING : It 's a fool 's game to predict a single mood or top issue across the entire WEF . But there seems to be a gap between loud public criticism of WEF participants and the event itself ( Bill Browder piles on here ) , and how those folks are behaving up the mountain . This year there 's less self-congratulatory guff and a more serious level of engagement among conference participants . The corporate speed dating of previous years is on the wane , and executives who previously did n't care about issues like refugee education or a functioning free press are actually listening to the consultancies and NGOs that insist that only leadership based on inclusion , diversity and sustainability can work in the future . The challenge : Can those leaders catch up with an increasingly angry public , and also tackle issues like tax ? <p> HAIR-RAISING MOMENTS : Did you know the crew at Kopp 's Coiffure is in action from 5:30 a.m. each morning this week , visiting hotel rooms and chalets to get the hair of the great , the good and the very , very rich ready for show ? The team expands from eight to 12 for WEF week , carting gear around in waterproof backpacks . They also have a huge new salon next to Congress Center open from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. for those who ca n't bear the thought of an early morning hotel visit . Playbook can vouch for their in-salon skill . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone .

( is the rating we gave Chinese President Xi Jinping for his glorious 2017 paean to globalization , sucking up to every pore of every being in the WEF realm ) . <p> OVERHEARD : A different type of ( be ) rating , at Anthony Scaramucci 's Skybridge wine tasting event Tuesday . One prominent editor criticized the WEF for choosing forum founder Klaus Schwab to interview Bolsonaro and WEF President B ? rge Brende for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , rather than journalists . " Blowjob " was the key word . Schwab resorted to the harshest form of criticism possible in Davos : An invitation to the audience to admire the natural beauties of Brazil . <p> THE MOOCH IS ON FIRE : Say what you will about Anthony Scaramucci 's notoriously loose mouth and flirtation with reality TV , but the Mooch knows how to be Donald Trump 's unchallenged main man in Davos , shutdown be damned . Last night 's Skybridge wine tasting was no exception : packed to the rafters , white-badge-holders galore being turned down for entry , and full of 97-point wines . The one point of backlash : the sip-sized servings . No one was there to learn to be a connoisseur ! <p> GREAT IDEA : Budweiser is to power all of Atlanta with green energy when it hosts the Super Bowl February 3 . <h> NOT TRENDING IN DAVOS <p> SAUDI MINISTER SET TO PULL OUT : He would n't be particularly welcome , but one upside to Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih 's attendance could be some actual diplomacy between him and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak -- their first face-to-face meeting since they orchestrated a new OPEC+ output agreement in Vienna in December . ( Though that conversation might further cement the idea that Davos is more welcoming to nasty governments than it should be . ) Bloomberg reports Khalid Al-Falih 's " travel plans are still in flux , so it 's still possible , albeit unlikely , he makes a flying visit to Davos on Friday . " <p> REFUNDS PLEASE ! Our Stateside colleague Daniel Lippman reports that a White House official told POLITICO the Trump administration is hard at work trying to get back the taxpayer dollars dropped on Davos hotels , before the Americans ' trip was canceled due to the U.S. government shutdown . The official said they hope to get the vast majority of the money back in the next few weeks . It 's a lot of cash : Quartz reported in December that the hotel tab for Donald Trump , a number of Cabinet members and other officials ( including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner ) had already hit about $2.9 million . <p> WHO NEEDS FEEDBACK ? ' JUST KEEP GOING : ' DHL chief Frank Appel has a message for his fellow globalizers : " Just keep going . " He told CNBC Tuesday morning that his company 's annual connectedness survey shows 2017 was globalization 's best year ever , with 2018 a close second . " Globalization is not on the retreat , it 's continued , despite all the noise . So , sometimes I say , better do n't open the newspapers , just keep going , " he said . Appel expanded on the comments on Tuesday 's POLITICO WEF panel with our Global Editor Matt Kaminski . Also on the panel : UBS ' Sabine Keller-Busse , WEF 's Richard Samans , and Lippo Group 's James Riady . <p> CATCHPHRASE CAR CRASH : Are we living in a " 5G World , " " Globalization 4.0 " or the " Fourth Industrial Revolution ? " WEF needs to decide . At this rate it 's destined to be the public-private partnership version of the European Commission : so chock-full of people who feel entitled to be heard , the message often gets lost . <p> SLOW DOWN , IT 'S ONLY A SLOWDOWN NOT A COLLAPSE : The WEF really wants you to know that slower growth does n't equal recession . The forum predicts central banks are likely to moderate monetary policy to keep economic " soft spots " from turning into sharp declines , and says it hopes the opening up of China 's market will soften the blows . " Slowing down in China is not a collapse , " noted Fang Xinghai , the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission , in Davos . Economic experts predict 6-percent growth in China for 2019 , which seems strong , but is often regarding as the tipping point into social chaos in China if it goes any lower . <h> TODAY 'S BUSINESS <p> EUROPE DAY -- IN SAFE WATERS AGAIN : It 's Europe Day in Davos , with leaders of three out of the five biggest economies speaking today . German Chancellor Angela Merkel gets the special 45-minute treatment ( plus her session is chaired by WEF founder Klaus Schwab ) . Italy 's Giuseppe Conte and Spain 's Pedro S ? nchez follow later in the afternoon , with half an hour each . <p> European self-evaluation : . " It 's a fact that in the past two years , Europe has provided much-needed ' life-support ' to the global multilateral order , and that 's despite all the internal challenges we faced , especially Brexit , " Ann Mettler told Playbook . She 's the head of EPSC , the European Commission 's in-house think tank . " I do n't know where the climate agenda would be if the COP24 had failed without our help in brokering a deal , or how much stronger protectionism would be had we not tried to counter it with an active trade policy . " Read the latest EPSC paper , pegged to the WEF . <p> HAPPENING TODAY -- EU-JAPAN DATA DOUBLE ACT : The European Commission will today certify that data transferred from the EU to Japan enjoys protection standards in line with European ones . And with that , the two can lay claim to having created the world 's largest area of data flows reciprocally considered safe . <p> Why are we telling you ? First , because unless you read Brussels Playbook ( BTW : you really should ! ) , you would n't have known about it . Second , Japan 's PM Abe , speaking in Davos today , is expected to announce that his government will take the same decision today , diplomats told us.The EU and Japan are putting yet another piece in place for the biggest trade and economic partnership agreement ever concluded by the EU , which is yet another occasion for the so-far endless series of their joint efforts to demonstrate that rule-based trade is alive and kicking . <p> ON THAT NOTE , FREE TRADE IS GREAT , SAYS LEADERLESS BRITISH DELEGATION ... on one of the most expensive billboards in Davos . Ministerial back-up will arrive today -- up to seven members of the U.K. Cabinet will be in Davos . <p> FACEBOOK WATCH : The company 's engagement ramps up today , to include a media reception and an in-demand speech session featuring COO Sheryl Sandberg and hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit . <h> TUESDAY WRAP <p> MIKE POMPEO 'S ' BEAUTIFUL COALITIONS : ' U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a boiler-plate recitation of the Trump administration 's claimed achievements and its " unleashing of animal spirits " to help the economy grow . He praised " beautiful coalitions " and repeated the claim that ISIS has been defeated . He rejected the idea that conflict with China is inevitable , but said transparency and fairness is needed from Beijing to avoid trade and other clashes . He likewise said the U.S. and Russia are not " destined to be antagonists but it will take a Russian change " to keep the peace . <p> On reforms he wants to see in NATO , the UN and EU : " I do n't have time today to go into each of them ... but it 's not about taking these institutions down , " Pompeo said . He added that " voters have tuned out politics " and are revolting around the world . " People are asking questions that have n't been asked , or have n't been taken seriously for a very long time , " Pompeo said , characterizing Donald Trump 's election as a fightback against " low expectations . " <p> Pompeo rated:Playbook gives his speech . His prepared text was n't memorable , but he talked soft and angled hard on the WEF 's weak point : That its elite audiences avoid hard questions about how they got to be so successful . <p> BRAZILIAN OFFER YOU CA N'T RESIST : Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gave the WEF crowd another opportunity to choose between their collective sense of responsibility as citizens of everywhere and the business opportunities that a strict -- or should we say brutal -- anti-corruption agenda might bring . " Our measures will certainly provide you with incentives to do business , " said Bolsonaro , presenting the " new Brazil that we 're building " as a place open to trading with the world and to investment . His plans include pouring cash into safety and security , he said , " so you all can come visit with your families . " <p> Bolsonaro ( who strangely wore an overcoat on stage -- is that a new thing ? ) argued environmental issues " need to go hand-in-hand " with economic development , meaning " one must not emphasize one over the other , and insisted only 9 percent of Brazil 's soil was used by farmers today . <p> WHERE WERE THE WOMEN ? At Tina Brown 's annual Women of Impact dinner , hosted with Credit Suisse for the eighth time . The key speeches were from Michelle Bachelet , who was recently appointed as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and was Chile 's first female president , and Lina Khalifeh , the Jordanian founder of SheFighter , a self-defense studio . Other guests included IMF chief Christine Lagarde , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Queen Rania of Jordan , who turned up for dessert . Brown kicked on at Davos House . <h> NEW DEAL FOR NATURE <p> WHOSE PLANET IS IT ANYWAY ? Naturalist David Attenborough has a new Netflix series to promote , which will debut at the WEF . It 's called " Our Planet " and looks spectacular , judging from a clip the audience previewed Tuesday . Not bad work for a 92-year-old icon . He offered the Davos crown an 11th commandment to observe : " Care for the natural world , and treat it with a deal of respect , " he told an admiring Duke of Cambridge , who got to interview him on stage . <p> So what 's it all about ? A " New Deal for Nature , " as a follow-up and extension of the Paris Climate Agreement . Playbook 's Florian Eder sat down for a chat with WWF International 's Director-General Marco Lambertini , whose organization is pushing for the new deal . <p> Lambertini 's challenge to WEF attendees : " This is the group of people that accounts for most of the carbon footprint today , so it goes without saying that it must be also the group of people that must start to design the solution , " he told Playbook . " And business is beginning to get it . " His evidence for that ? " In Davos , we 've been always confronting this sector . Today , we 're working together . It 's amazing that that happened only in a decade , " Lambertini said . <p> What is that new deal ? " We need to produce more food with less of everything . Less water , less land , less energy , fertilizers , less pesticides . Today , the food system is broken , is clearly not sustainable , we 're heading towards a collapse of the food system . We need to green that system , with clear targets . " <p> Lambertini says we are not doing enough on the climate , but should n't stop there anyway : " If climate is dangerous enough for business , do n't think that a collapse of the ocean of the forest system , will be less dangerous . " <p> Lambertini on Bolsonaro : Brazil 's strongman president started his term by making it easier to deforest the Amazon . " Bolsonaro is not the first , " said Lambertini . " And look what happened when Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from Paris : A wave of companies , states and mayors , stepped up and said ' we 're still in , we want to contribute even if the government does n't . ' Sometimes , these kind of radical views trigger and accelerate reaction from society , but of course they are also a concern . " <p> What would Lambertini tell Bolsonaro if he ran into him in Davos ? " I would like to say that people like Trump , Bolsonaro -- sovereignists , unilateralists , populists -- were not elected on anti-environmental agendas . The majority in America are concerned about climate change . They experience it three or four times a year now . That 's what we are trying to convey to these leaders : Do n't embrace an anti-environmental agenda , because you 're failing a large part of your electorate . " <p> THANKS to Natasha Bernard , Giulia Chiatante and Dari Gessner for making last night 's POLITICO party possible . And to Jake Evans for being an all-round Davos superman . <p> DAVOS PLAYBOOK COULD N'T HAPPEN WITHOUT : Our editor Zoya Sheftalovich . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future . We have invested more than $4.5 billion USD in research and development to provide adult smokers with better options to continued smoking . Behind this investment , and behind every advancement at Philip Morris International , is robust science . We are harnessing recent breakthroughs in technology to develop smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes that are much less harmful than continued smoking . But innovative products and solutions do nothing if people do n't know about them . That 's why we 're calling upon the world 's leaders to join in a global conversation . It 's time for governments , regulators , NGOs and scientists to study the scientific assessments and evidence for alternative products . Philip Morris International is ready and willing to talk with people across all sectors and all points of view , including those who disagree . 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options .

Created by Freuds and set in a cozy , low-ceilinged golf club , Davos House instantly set itself apart from other crammed venues in town , not least because it afforded Blaine the chance to wow a crowd that included Queen Rania of Jordan and former U.K. Chancellor George Osborne with a series of stunning card illusions . <p> The takeaway : The Davos audience may be in the land of 24/7 make-believe ( where the cards are always stacked ) , but Blaine provided the first illusion that actually impressed everyone . <p> PLAN B : If you 're not on the door list at Davos House , do n't worry . Indonesia 's WIR Group is offering you the chance to test its " Location-Based Augmented Reality Game Platform " from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. today at the Indonesia Pavillon . It sounds rather like Brexit . And if you 'd rather find out what it 's like to be a tree ( yes , really ) , then visit the Tree VR exhibition inside the Congress Center . We 'd give you a preview , but the organizers said WEF had n't told them if journalists were allowed in . <p> DAVOS PRO TIP -- MAKE A DINNER EFFORT : The thing everyone hates ( but insists on having ) in Davos is an invite to a private dinner . They 're annoying because getting around Davos is complicated , but they 're also a good chance to pick apart whatever has happened on the main stage that day . Nearly every big company runs one , as do consultancies , including Brunswick and Finsbury 's tonight . <p> Playbook -- along with HuffPost 's Louise Roug -- kicked off the International Hotel Group dinner Monday at the InterContinental , where Prince William and many of the big leaders stay . It was a refreshingly grounded discussion . Listen to the first episode of our Davos Confidential podcast , featuring Roug and former Formula One driver Nico Rosberg , to find out more . What made the IHG dinner work is that everyone debated on an equal footing . More please ! <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone .

Learn more here. ** <h> EVERYTHING IS THE BEST CORNER <p> OPTIMISM IS N'T ENOUGH : One of the golden rules of Davos is to be optimistic : The forum is full of " can-do " people who , to be fair , have done many valuable things . But what Davos-goers tend to collectively recoil at is bearers of bad news , or those who doubt everything can be " win-win . " <p> If that sounds like a fundamental clash , that 's because it is . <p> How else do you explain organizations repeatedly warning about extreme inequality at the WEF , while the decision-makers who attend the forum ( and their companies ) grow markedly wealthier , some of them exponentially so , off the back of cheap debt and tax avoidance . That might be unfair but manageable if the wages and opportunities of the global middle and working classes were n't stagnating in many countries . A new worldwide UNICEF survey of 10,000 youth demonstrated staggeringly simple asks : more jobs and better education . Something 's got to give to fund those demands -- perhaps higher tax . If not , the response to exponential wealth might be exponential populism . <h> OH THE HUMANITY <p> NO MORE DAVOS MAN : " Human " is the word popping up everywhere this year . " Humans of Davos " is how the sub-30-year-old Global Shapers are framing their perspectives . Check out Hicham Sabir 's Davos diary . <p> BETTER PEOPLE : " We Are All Human " wants to harness the " unrealized potential of U.S. Hispanics , the under-appreciated heart of the American economy , " said Claudia Romo Edelman , a Swiss-Mexican diplomat who founded the organization . Another Edelman -- Margot -- is moderating " Magic at the edge of menace : How tech makes us human " from 12.30 p.m. to 1 p.m. at the Tradeshift Sanctuary . <h> TREND WATCH <p> TECH 'S TRUST PROBLEM IS NOW A CEO PROBLEM : IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is on a trust campaign this week : It 's not just lack of faith in an aspect of tech ( such as AI or data ) that 's got her worried , but trust in technology as a whole . Responsibility and transparency will be the keywords during a panel at 5.45 p.m. today called " Business Leadership in the Fourth Industrial Revolution . " Rometty 's also part of the wave of tech leaders prepared to say that " carefully targeted " government regulation is a good thing , not the devil . <p> CLIMATE CHANGE BANKRUPTCIES : The Wall Street Journal 's Russell Gold writes that California 's largest utility PG&amp;E Corp was overwhelmed by rapid climatic change as a prolonged drought dried out much of the state and decimated forests . On Monday the company , which was recently valued at $25 billion , said it planned to file for Chapter 11 protection by month 's end , citing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and 750 lawsuits from wildfires potentially caused by its power lines . Its value has sunk to $4 billion . <p> WHAT DO CEOS THINK ? PwC asked Davos Man ( and occasional woman ) in its 22nd annual survey of the world 's bosses . Almost one in three CEOs globally said they thought economic growth will decline over the course of this year . That 's about six times as many as last year , " a record jump in pessimism , " as the annual survey of 1,300 CEOs around the world notes . " CEOs also reported a noteworthy dip in confidence in their own organizations ' revenue prospects over the short ( 12-month ) and medium ( three-year ) term . " More of them think AI will destroy more jobs than it creates . <p> Corporate oracles : The report , published Monday evening , has been a good indicator of the mood of the globe 's economic elite in the past -- and of how the real economy 's doing . The silver lining : 42 percent of the respondents still foresee an improved economic outlook ( down from 57 percent last year ) . <p> A DAVOS RECORD ? CNBC is interviewing 33 CEOs , chairmen or ministers today . That 's got to be some kind of record . Tell us if we 're wrong . <p> Playbook 's question for Publicis Groupe 's Maurice L ? vy , one of the CNBC interviewees : How much money do you make running the hotel-room system in Davos during the WEF ? <h> TODAY 'S TOP LINE-UPS <p> WHO 'S ON FIRST : Brazil 's far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro makes his d ? but on the international stage at 2:30 p.m . His speech will be the first by a global big wig at this year 's forum . Critics call Bolsonaro a homophobe , racist , a denier of climate change , among other things . But the WEF 's an inclusive place . <h> WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT DAVOS <p> Rob Cox for Reuters brands Davos " a liability in the populist era " to explain why Donald Trump , Emmanuel Macron , Theresa May , Narendra Modi and Justin Trudeau are skipping this year 's summit . But that leaves room for the leaders of Ethiopia , Vietnam and South Africa , for example . <p> David A. Andelman for CNN says Trump is smart to skip Davos , though he still ca n't distinguish between useful and expendable international events . <p> Jorge Valero for Euractiv compliments the WEF on raising tough issues but concludes : " The sense of urgency is short-lived , as fairer salaries and more inclusive societies are n't part of CEOs ' speed-dating chats or the fancy Russian parties in the Swiss resort . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> OOPS ... Which hotel and restaurant sent its inflated price list to a prospective client with the file name : " SpecialWEFprices.pdf " ? <p> PRIVACY PLEASE , NO PHOTOS : Hotel Schatzalp -- the venue for tonight 's most fun appointment , for POLITICO 's own podcast-recording slash drinks slash sled-run event -- has banned staff from using smartphones during their shifts throughout the WEF week , according to a note spotted by Playbook at the hotel 's piano bar . <p> CELEB SPOTTING:Wyclef Jean will grace the Wall Street Journal party tonight , and Sting is set to appear at the Salesforce nightcap Thursday . Will.i.am , a Davos commodity these days , performed at the TIME reception Monday night . <p> MEET REAL DAVOSIANS : For the first time this year , Davos residents were invited to take part in a lottery -- with the big prize being a WEF badge . There are five lucky winners ( out of the 87 who took part ) , local paper Davoser Zeitung reported in its hard copy edition . <p> PROTEST DU JOUR : Hanging on two balconies , right around the corner from the Hotel Belvedere , a hand-written sign : " Klaus Schwab fucked up our town . " Then below it : " His friends fucked up the world . " <p> BEST MONDAY PARTY VIEW : Quartz 's welcome drinks at the Berghaus Jschalp , a gondola ride up from Davos Platz . The cashmere-y scarves , courtesy of WorldQuant , were a nice touch . <h> ICYMI <p> A DAVOS COLD SHOWER : The International Monetary Fund revised ( downwards ) its outlook for the world economy , with the expectation for expansion now 3.5 percent for 2019 and 3.6 percent for next year , 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points below October 's projections respectively . The " global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected , " the IMF 's new chief economist , Gita Gopinath , wrote on her blog . <p> The queen of the mountain , Christine Lagarde , said at a press conference Monday that the IMF would " now announce a further downgrade of our forecast . The bottom line is , after two years of solid expansion , the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising , " especially because free trade is becoming a toxic cause and old models of multilateralism are falling apart . Expect a " serious slowdown " if policymakers do n't change course by keeping trade open , reducing public debt , shutting down tax avoidance and making sure the digital revolution is inclusive . <p> DAVID CAMERON 'S ' STUPID ' REFERENDUM : Unlike most of the British government , which is stuck at home managing the mess of Brexit , David Cameron is back in Davos . The former British PM is sticking to private events like dinners rather than the main stage , which might be just as well , given the revelations from an explosive new BBC 2 series out January 28 called " Inside Europe : 10 Years of Turmoil . " Donald Tusk tells the BBC about conversations he had with Cameron back in 2016 , in which the European Council president said he told the then-British PM to " get real " as he was trying to negotiate a deal with the EU ahead of the " stupid " Brexit referendum . " I told him bluntly , ' come on David , get real . I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you , but believe me the truth is that no one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum . ' " <p> DAVOS GOT TALENT : INSEAD , Tata Communications and the Adecco Group 's Global Talent Competitiveness Index ( GTCI ) ranks 125 countries and 114 cities across all groups of income and levels of development . Talent is still drawn to small , high-income economies and the United States . Switzerland tops the index , followed by Singapore , the United States , Norway and Denmark <p> THE SECURITY BILL : It 's costing 9 million Swiss francs ( close to ? 8 million ) to protect the 3,000 WEF-goers . That 's 3,000 francs of security per person . Of course there are many more folks outside the secure zone who enjoy the spillover benefits ( and delays ) of the security service . The costs are shared among the Davos partners : The canton of Graub ? nden chipped in 2.25 million francs , Davos city 1.125 million , the Swiss government 3.375 million and the WEF itself 2.25 million . A true public-private partnership on costs . <p> CORRECTION : We sent you the wrong way Monday when we wrote about the latest Edelman Trust Barometer . Here 's the correct link .

@@41694141 <h> Can Apple sustain strong momentum amid coronavirus fears ? <p> Apple has reported record results for the three months to December , beating Wall Street estimates . <p> Its newly launched iPhone 11 series brought sales of the iconic smartphone back to the growth path while other new businesses such as wearables and subscription services achieved double-digit growth . <p> As Apple is set to launch its 5G products later this year , such strong results demonstrated that the technology giant can still grow its iPhone business even though the global smartphone market is slowing down . <p> The iPhone business contributed US$56 billion in revenue for the quarter , up 8 percent from a year earlier . The strong growth was mainly due to the strong demand for the iPhone 11 series . Apple said iPhone 11 , the cheapest model of the series , was the top-selling model for every week in December . The three models of the series also proved the most popular iPhones . <p> Apple has been shifting its business strategy for the iPhone in view of the global smartphone market slowdown . It decided not to raise iPhone prices for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its predecessor , the iPhone XR , and this attracted many smartphone users to give the iPhone a try -- even if the latest models did not offer 5G mobile network connectivity . <p> Many Chinese customers , who have been using Android smartphones for a long period of time , decided to switch to iPhone 11 because of the lower price . <p> Actually , Apple tested the market with a much wider price band for its iPhone products . The iPhone is no longer a product just for the high-end market , but it can also serve the mid-range segment . <p> As the company sought to capture the mid-range clientele and even the entry-level market , it has been rumored that Apple would launch an iPhone with a smaller screen size in the first quarter this year . <p> It is said that the new iPhone , dubbed iPhone SE2 , could come with a 4.7-inch screen and the latest A13 processor , and the price could be as low as US$39 . <p> Some media outlets reported that Apple was aiming to ship 15 million units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged its partners to ship a total of 80 million units of iPhones in the first half amid a stronger than expected demand . <p> Unfortunately , Apple 's ambitious plan could be affected by the outbreak of the new coronavirus in Wuhan , the capital of central China 's Hubei province . <p> The epicenter of the outbreak is near the iPhone manufacturing bases . So far , business activities in the city have ground to a halt and employees have been told not to report back to work until February . <p> Contingency plan <p> That could pose a negative impact on the supply of iPhones in the near term . However , Foxconn , an iPhone contract maker , said that the company has a contingency plan to maintain its iPhone business . <p> While no details have been provided , it can be assumed that Foxconn will make the latest model in India and Taiwan , where it also has iPhone manufacturing plants . <p> The strong iPhone demand led to an increase in the number of active users within Apple ecosystem . Apple said its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up by over 100 million in the last 12 months . <p> The active installed base is a key indicator of Apple users ' stickiness to its ecosystem . Such a huge user base serves as a solid foundation for Apple to expand its service business , especially its subscription-based services . <p> Apple said it had over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services , up 120 million from a year ago . It expects to surpass the 500 million mark during the March quarter . <p> The company has set a new target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of this year , and this means 40 percent of Apple installed bases are paying for services . <p> Unique service offerings <p> During the reporting period , revenue for services reached US$12.7 billion , up around 18 percent from a year earlier . <p> The company was able to attract users to try its unique service offerings such as payment , news , music and cloud storage . <p> For example , Apple Pay 's revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with a run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment system was accepted in more public transport systems such as trains and buses in London , Shenzhen and Guangzhou . <p> Apple News , on the other hand , attracted over 100 million monthly active users in the United States , Australia and Canada , and provided a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories . <p> Such services did help to lock users to the iPhone as it provided some exclusive content for them . <p> The coronavirus may eventually hit hardware sales in China as shops are closed . <p> But Apple 's overall growth momentum should not be affected as its users continue to spend more on service subscriptions , and the rising penetration of Apple Pay will also help boost service revenue . <p> SpaceX , the private rocket company of high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk , won final approval to build a research and manufacturing plant for its deep-space Starship project on a tract of vacant land at the Port ... <p> California power producer PG&amp;E Corp said on Tuesday that it plans to raise up to US$25.68 billion by selling securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , Reuters reports .

@@71780341 <h> Covid-19 comes to India <p> No one can accuse the Indian government of being lax on account of the coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) outbreak . On the very day the WHO declared it to be a pandemic , the government took the drastic step of suspending all visas for entry into India and restricted the arrival of people from abroad . These steps were taken under the directions of a Group of Ministers ( GoM ) under the ambit of the 1897 Epidemic Disease Act under which the government can detain people or vessel that comes from abroad . <p> India has only a few cases right now according to Lav Aggarwal , Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health all connected to people who came from abroad . As yet there is no evidence that it has reached the stage of " community spread " where it freely spreads among people who have not travelled or even met anyone from abroad . The government says that more than 1 million people have been screened , but these are the people going through airports . The true extent of the problem would only be indicated if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those already infected .

This will inevitably build a great deal of pressure on India 's healthcare system , which is not the greatest in the world to start with . At the end of the day , its incidence will depend on the political leadership , the national policies they unveil and the capacities that the country possesses . <p> As of March 13 there are 73 confirmed cases in India , with one death and four people have recovered . Given the size of the country this is a small number . Little Denmark already has 516 cases , and France , Spain and Germany already have thousands of cases . France has had 42 fatalities , Spain 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of the virus is a good move . <p> On March 12 , the Director-General of the WHO said that the organisation had made their assessment that the outbreak was a pandemic for two reasons -- the speed and scale of transmission . 125 , 00 cases had been reported and that the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold in the previous two weeks . This , he said is a controllable pandemic , but warned that " despite our frequent warnings , we are deeply concerned that some countries are not approaching this threat with the level of political commitment needed to control it . " <p> The Covid 19 pandemic is going to have serious global consequences . Besides the illness and death it brings , it will see a lockdown of more countries , the suspension of air travel across regions , a gutting of financial markets and trade . Within countries you could well see healthcare systems overwhelmed as in Wuhan and Italy . According to one analysis , countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of anywhere between 0.5-0.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatically higher rate between 3-5 per cent . <h> Early measures for containment <p> India will not be immune to these developments . Indeed , our challenge will be to keep our fatality rate low , take containment measures that will give our already stressed public health system time to cope with the situation . Containment means making sure that all cases are identified , controlled and isolated . The idea is to limit people coming in , identify the sick , immediately isolate them , track all their contacts and quarantine them . So far it seems to be working in India . By early March it had 31 people confirmed with the disease . Screenings in airports had already tested 3500 samples and screened 600,000 visitors . In early March , Prime Minister Modi declared he would not participate in any Holi Milan programme . He also cancelled travel plans for a summit with the EU in Brussels and later his visit to Bangladesh was called off . <p> In a suo motu statement to Parliament on March 5 , Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the External Affairs Minister , Minister of Civil Aviation , Minister of Stat for Home Affairs , Minister of State for Shipping and chaired by him to monitor the situation . The Cabinet Secretary , too , was constantly reviewing the situation with a number of ministries , including those of MEA , Pharma , Commerce and State Chief Secretaries . On March 3 all visas for Japan , South Korea , and Iran were suspended . Visas from China had been suspended a month earlier on February 5 . Subsequently arrivals for people who had been to any of these countries were also suspended . Screening of passengers in major airports was begin in mid-January and expanded to a total of 21 airports . This was then expanded to cover 12 major and 75 minor sea ports as well . <p> Besides the National Institute of Virology , India has 15 laboratories to test the virus , and Dr Harsh Vardhan said the government had asked 19 more to conduct the tests . In the statement made on 5 March , Union Health Minister also noted that routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28,000 people had been tracked and monitored through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Network run by state and district surveillance networks . There are two quarantine centres to isolate passengers showing signs of infection . One is located in Manesar , Haryana and is managed by the Armed Forces Medical Services , and the other at Chawla Camp in New Delhi managed by the ITBP . <h> Mitigation <p> So far , in terms of containment , India has not done too badly . But we must be prepared for mitigation meaning drastic measures to enforce social distancing -- closing schools , shops , cinemas , banning public events , even shutting down mass transit systems . The second element would be to provide care for those infected . Here , we 're in big trouble . India 's public health network which is , to use the polite word , " patchy . " Its hospitals are already overcrowded and in many places lacks even basic equipment . At present India spends only 1.3 per cent of its GDP on health . <p> As of July 2018 , India has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals , but the number is heavily skewed towards the urban areas . Further , the distribution is hugely disparate . Thus Delhi may have 24,383 beds , all of Uttar Pradesh has just 37 , 156 . An intensified spread of Covid-19 could put up a demand for millions of more beds . According to a WHO-China joint mission report , 5% of people diagnosed with Covid-19 require artificial respiration , another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen and not just for a few days since the duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients ( compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill ) . So , high quality care is needed by the 20 per cent or so who are infected , which really means ICU-level care . According to one study , in India there are some 70,000 ICU beds available , in big and small hospitals and nursing homes . These cater to some 5 million patients requiring ICU admissions every year , so there is already a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiratory system , critical patients can not survive without ventilators . Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is an acute shortage of ventilators across the Indian health system . Take Delhi there are only an estimated 440 ventilators in government hospitals , of which , as of August 2019 , 44 were not functioning . Besides , there will be problems with the levels of hygiene considering that a lot of these beds are in primary health centres and community health centres , hardly having the level of high quality care needed , required which led as in the case of Wuhan , to the deaths of a large number of medical professionals . <p> Another major problem is that just about 44 per cent of the country 's 1.3 billion population have some kind of a health insurance -- either paid for by the government , employers or individuals . This is bound to be a major factor in the quality of treatment that anyone infected by Covid-19 will receive . Most private hospitals charge anywhere between Rs 15,000 -- 20,000 per day for ventilator support alone . Truth be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the number of doctors or specialised equipment like ventilators , states like UP , Bihar , Jharkhand , Orissa , Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are already in a hopeless situation . <h> Economic Impact <p> Covid-19 has already hit the stock market which has seen its biggest fall in history on Thursday . Other sectors like tourism and travel have also been hit and related to this is civil aviation which will get affected because of flight cancellations and visa restrictions . If the situation deteriorates in India , and there are lockdowns in parts of the country , there could be a major disruption of economic activity in the country .

On the very day the WHO declared it to be a pandemic , the government took the drastic step of suspending all visas for entry into India and restricted the arrival of people from abroad . These steps were taken under the directions of a Group of Ministers ( GoM ) under the ambit of the 1897 Epidemic Disease Act under which the government can detain people or vessel that comes from abroad . India has only a few cases right now according to Lav Aggarwal , Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health all connected to people who came from abroad . As yet there is no evidence that it has reached the stage of " community spread " where it freely spreads among people who have not travelled or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1 million people have been screened , but these are the people going through airports . The true extent of the problem would only be indicated if there was larger scale testing of those who have come into contact with those already infected . As of now we have no information on the extent to which these tests have been carried out . Given the route it has taken we should be prepared for an exponential spread of the virus . In keeping with the global trend it is more than certain that containment efforts will not be entirely successful and we will have to act to mitigate its spread . This will inevitably build a great deal of pressure on India 's healthcare system , which is not the greatest in the world to start with . At the end of the day , its incidence will depend on the political leadership , the national policies they unveil and the capacities that the country possesses . As of March 13 there are 73 confirmed cases in India , with one death and four people have recovered . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Denmark already has 516 cases , and France , Spain and Germany already have thousands of cases . France has had 42 fatalities , Spain 55 and Germany 3 . So any step taken to slow the spread of the virus is a good move . On March 12 , the Director-General of the WHO said that the organisation had made their assessment that the outbreak was a pandemic for two reasons -- the speed and scale of transmission . 125 , 00 cases had been reported and that the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold in the previous two weeks . This , he said is a controllable pandemic , but warned that " despite our frequent warnings , we are deeply concerned that some countries are not approaching this threat with the level of political commitment needed to control it . " The Covid 19 pandemic is going to have serious global consequences . Besides the illness and death it brings , it will see a lockdown of more countries , the suspension of air travel across regions , a gutting of financial markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems overwhelmed as in Wuhan and Italy . According to one analysis , countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of anywhere between 0.5-0.9 per cent , whereas those that are overwhelmed could have a dramatically higher rate between 3-5 per cent . <h> Early measures for containment <p> India will not be immune to these developments . Indeed , our challenge will be to keep our fatality rate low , take containment measures that will give our already stressed public health system time to cope with the situation . Containment means making sure that all cases are identified , controlled and isolated . The idea is to limit people coming in , identify the sick , immediately isolate them , track all their contacts and quarantine them . So far it seems to be working in India . By early March it had 31 people confirmed with the disease . Screenings in airports had already tested 3500 samples and screened 600,000 visitors . In early March , Prime Minister Modi declared he would not participate in any Holi Milan programme . He also cancelled travel plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to Bangladesh was called off . In a suo motu statement to Parliament on March 5 , Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that a Group of Ministers ( GoM ) had been constituted comprising of the External Affairs Minister , Minister of Civil Aviation , Minister of Stat for Home Affairs , Minister of State for Shipping and chaired by him to monitor the situation . The Cabinet Secretary , too , was constantly reviewing the situation with a number of ministries , including those of MEA , Pharma , Commerce and State Chief Secretaries . On March 3 all visas for Japan , South Korea , and Iran were suspended . Visas from China had been suspended a month earlier on February 5 . Subsequently arrivals for people who had been to any of these countries were also suspended . Screening of passengers in major airports was begin in mid-January and expanded to a total of 21 airports . This was then expanded to cover 12 major and 75 minor sea ports as well . Besides the National Institute of Virology , India has 15 laboratories to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked 19 more to conduct the tests . In the statement made on 5 March , Union Health Minister also noted that routine surveillance had also been initiated across the country and some 28,000 people had been tracked and monitored through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Network run by state and district surveillance networks . There are two quarantine centres to isolate passengers showing signs of infection . One is located in Manesar , Haryana and is managed by the Armed Forces Medical Services , and the other at Chawla Camp in New Delhi managed by the ITBP . <h> Mitigation <p> So far , in terms of containment , India has not done too badly . But we must be prepared for mitigation meaning drastic measures to enforce social distancing -- closing schools , shops , cinemas , banning public events , even shutting down mass transit systems . The second element would be to provide care for those infected . Here , we 're in big trouble . India 's public health network which is , to use the polite word , " patchy . " Its hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . At present India spends only 1.3 per cent of its GDP on health . As of July 2018 , India has a total of some 1.2 million hospital beds in government hospitals , but the number is heavily skewed towards the urban areas . Further , the distribution is hugely disparate . Thus Delhi may have 24,383 beds , all of Uttar Pradesh has just 37 , 156 . An intensified spread of Covid-19 could put up a demand for millions of more beds . According to a WHO-China joint mission report , 5% of people diagnosed with Covid-19 require artificial respiration , another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen and not just for a few days since the duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients ( compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill ) . So , high quality care is needed by the 20 per cent or so who are infected , which really means ICU-level care . According to one study , in India there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals and nursing homes . These cater to some 5 million patients requiring ICU admissions every year , so there is already a queue for them . Given that Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system , critical patients can not survive without ventilators . Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is an acute shortage of ventilators across the Indian health system . Take Delhi there are only an estimated 440 ventilators in government hospitals , of which , as of August 2019 , 44 were not functioning . Besides , there will be problems with the levels of hygiene considering that a lot of these beds are in primary health centres and community health centres , hardly having the level of high quality care needed , required which led as in the case of Wuhan , to the deaths of a large number of medical professionals . Another major problem is that just about 44 per cent of the country 's 1.3 billion population have some kind of a health insurance -- either paid for by the government , employers or individuals . This is bound to be a major factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive . Most private hospitals charge anywhere between Rs 15,000 -- 20,000 per day for ventilator support alone . Truth be told , whether it is the number of beds available , or the number of doctors or specialised equipment like ventilators , states like UP , Bihar , Jharkhand , Orissa , Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are already in a hopeless situation . <h> Economic Impact <p> Covid-19 has already hit the stock market which has seen its biggest fall in history on Thursday . Other sectors like tourism and travel have also been hit and related to this is civil aviation which will get affected because of flight cancellations and visa restrictions . If the situation deteriorates in India , and there are lockdowns in parts of the country , there could be a major disruption of economic activity in the country . Trade with China which exports telecom instruments , electronic components , computer hardware and peripherals , industrial machinery and organic chemicals has already been affected . Of immediate concern has been the issue of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ( API ) that India imports to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharma industry needs comes from China .

We enjoy a wide range of shopping and service <p> establishments , relative to other small communities , due to the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these establishments depend on and appreciate <p> these vacationers most of all . This summer , however , with the threat that COVID-19 <p> infections may spread beyond what our county hospital can manage , we should be <p> following the guidelines set by health authorities , including epidemiology scientists , even <p> if doing so disrupts our economy for a few more months . <p> In an opinion statement dated April 24 that appeared in the Ruidoso News , Rep. Zachary Cook began by telling us that " New Mexico is in a defining moment " with regards to the COVD-19 pandemic . I agree with that , though there is little else in his statement I can agree with . I 'll take his opening warning a step further and a bit closer to home : the citizens of Ruidoso and Lincoln County are , as we begin the summer vacation/tourist season , in a moment of potentially severe crisis .

This means keeping as many businesses and workplaces open as can safely be done . ' National lockdown ' and ' national shutdown ' are unfortunate terms as they do n't reflect what needs to be done . <p> We need to close workplaces that represent a clear and present danger to the spread of COVID-19 . We need people to severely limit their travel and contacts . Nothing more , nothing less . <p> It is disappointing that for many the COVID-19 response is being promoted as a contest between these two objectives . For the good of our country , it can not be .

Our world record of 29 years of successive economic growth means we will emerge in a much stronger position compared with many other world economies . <p> While we have criticised the banks in recent years , Peter Strong and all my fellow board members have been privileged to see how the strength of our banking system is now being harnessed for the good of every Australian . Together with their peers , Australian Banking Association chair Matt Comyn and CEO Anna Bligh have put the banking system at the full disposal of the national economy . <p> There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in the background .

Together , with a collaboration of other peak business bodies , we have united to call for more meaningful assistance to flow to displaced employees . <p> If employer groups and unions can work together to address these challenges , then anything is possible . <p> And so , we come back to the point of what is missing : belief . Granted , it is hard to believe in the face of uncertainty , but we are well placed to survive the economic hit over time . COVID-19 is bigger than anything we have faced , barring the great wars , but as people ( or society ) we possess the resourcefulness to overcome it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' blind hope ' . Nor is it ' unrealistically optimistic ' . All the things we need to get through this are already in place . The next few months will be testing times with mourning and grief to be experienced , but I believe our own resilience , and our leaders ' fortitude , will see us through that . We must be confident that , after the worst of it , we will rebound faster than other economies . <p> We are all in this together . Criticising each other is a waste of time and energy . We must first believe that we can recover and protect our most vulnerable . And then each of us must work cooperatively to make it happen . <p> The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses . So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ?

@@51638141 <p> Thank you and welcome to this quarter 1 result presentation . Yes , officially , quarter 1 result presentation . But since Duni , for the first time ever , today has released forecast for quarter 2 , I know there 's probably a lot of interest in talking about that . And I will come back to that . But since it is the Q1 presentation , let 's start with some highlights from the first quarter before we move into what we think about the COVID-19 impact of quarter 2 . <p> So if you 're looking at the net sales in the quarter , we saw totally a bit of decline with a couple of percentages . However , it was quite a difficult -- a different situation depending on which month you look at . We had actually a very good development in January and February , but then sales started to drop quite dramatically as from the middle of March due to , of course , the shutdown of restaurant and hotels across Europe in the -- because of COVID-19 . And we see that sales drop continue in Q2 . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means in terms of forecasts . <p> If you 're looking at the profit , that had a similar pattern , meaning we saw a decline totally in the quarter , but we actually had a very good profit development also in January and February . But then due to the volume drop in March that impacted the profit of March , dragging down the total quarter with SEK 13 million . <p> During the quarter , we also implemented a new sales and marketing organization , as previously announced . Reason being that we now are focusing on building 2 global brands , Duni and BioPak . That means that we also at from this in Q1 result presentation , also changing the way we 're reporting our financial situation . Instead of the 4 previous business areas , we 're now reporting into the Duni and BioPak segments . <p> The reason for the new sales and marketing organization was to strengthen our innovation , marketing and sales capabilities . That is a long-term objective . However , if you 're looking now at a more short-term impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to very fast implement our mitigation activities that proved to be important for us . And we also know that we will get to SEK 20 million yearly savings coming out of this new sales and marketing organization , which , of course , also contributes to better situation . <p> With that , I 'd like to have then a closer look at our 2 new segments then . First , starting with segment Duni . So in this segment , we provide innovative and sustainable solutions , mostly for the set table , and the biggest categories are napkins , table covers and candles . And it is in this segment that we see the biggest impact of COVID-19 situation , as you can see in both sales and operating income , which declined in the quarter . And again , it is the March numbers that impact the total quarter . <p> We see a bit of a difference between the different regions where Southern Europe is hit faster and stronger than Northern Europe . And that is , of course , in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All product categories are affected negatively , but mainly premium napkins and table cover . And although we see a positive impact on our material costs , it 's overshadowed by the negative impact from the lower volumes . <p> If we then move to the second segment , segment BioPak , which offers environmentally sound concepts in packaging and service products , and these products are sold a lot into the takeaway and ready-to-eat meals segments . There , we see that , actually , the sales and operating income growth also in quarter 1 and especially good growth in rest of the world . <p> So here , actually , the COVID-19 restriction increased demand for takeaway products during the end of the quarter . When restaurants were shutting down their sitdown services , they try to change into takeaway and delivery options . <p> The results were negatively impacted by weak Australian dollar , which , of course , now without big business in Australia , it 's impacting the total pictures . I 'd also like to mention that the Horizons business that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BioPak segment . <p> Now with that , I 'd like to leave the quarter 1 results and look at the situation moving into quarter 2 . And if we 're starting with having a look at what I 've written to the right , that is a key message I want to communicate . It is that we -- in Duni Group , we 're strong going into this situation . And with activity plans , we will also be strong after the COVID-19 situation . <p> So if we start then by looking at the sales situation , the basic situation to get good sales is , of course , that we have a healthy organization . And so far , we have no reported cases of corona or COVID-19 in the business . So we have put a lot of focus on keeping our organization healthy . And so far , we did success . And also , despite the work time reductions , we are also fully operational business . Including all our own operations , but also all our suppliers are operational . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a very good customer service level . So that is the basic is in place . <p> Then , of course , as we saw in the end of March , the COVID-19 lockdown is having a very strong impact on restaurants and hotels across the globe and especially in Europe . When that is said , there 's also an opportunity in takeaway , as I mentioned . Restaurants are shaping -- changing to more takeaway options . <p> Now since the sales start to decline already mid-March , we now have about a month of sales data , and sales have started to stabilize . That 's why we feel pretty confident in when we now forecast sales . And if we assume that the lockdown will remain for April , May and June , so total lockdown for the complete quarter , then that means that the sale will be reduced with more than 50% in the quarter . Of course , we all can hope that the lockdown will start to ease before that , but that would be the consequence if the lockdown remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hope for a recovery , and we expect the recovery to take place during the second half of the year , but it 's very difficult to forecast at what rate that recovery will take place . <p> So with sales starting to come down , we quickly started planning for actions . And number one is , of course , to then adapt our production capacity in line with the lower demand , and that has taken place . We have , through work time reduction , managed to decrease capacity in our converting factory and also at Rexcell . In Rexcell , we also have the opportunity on selling jumbo rolls for other applications than our table cover and napkins . And that work has proven to be successful , so we are now increasing our production times at Rexcell , which is very positive . <p> So work time reduction is the biggest cost reduction -- biggest part of the cost reduction program , but we are also initiating and have initiated already many other initiatives , including cutting down of consultants , short-term employment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program in quarter 2 is now in the level of SEK 150 million . And there , we see no restructuring costs , and it will have an impact already as from the beginning of April . <p> We have also previously announced that the Board proposed to withdraw the already proposed dividend for this year . So with these activities , we see no need for additional liquidity . We have confidence that the loan facilities we have will cover and bridge us in this situation . So that is , of course , positive news . <p> But overall , you can say that we plan for the worst here . In most normal business situation , you do a forecast , which is realistic , and then you do best case and worst case . We did a forecast , which we believe was realistic . Then we did a worst case and much worst case , and we planned our costs according to the much worst case . So hopefully , we will get into a better situation that we plan for , but we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quarter 2 . If we then dare to also lift our eyes a bit what 's going to happen when the market starts to open up again . I think we 're all aware of the discussions and the difficult balances of short-term health impact versus the long-term financial and long-term health impacts of the shutdown . So many countries now are planning for opening up the countries again . One interesting aspect that we see is , of course , that a lot of people being in quarantine situation now at home have a very strong need for social interactions . That 's why we believe that when the restaurants do start to open up again , there could be an opportunity for quite a quick recovery . <p> We also believe that when the restaurants open up , there will still be demand for more and stricter hygiene routines and hygiene products in the restaurants . And there , we feel well equipped . We have good table covers that will secure totally hygiene situation between each of the guests . We have napkin solutions that covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cetera . So good product offers in the area of hygiene , and we can help restaurants to build confidence to their customers that they have a hygienic operation . <p> We also now have built in the last year up a very strong business with 1 billion turnover in takeaway products . And here , we can also help our restaurants to build a second leg of their operations with strong takeaway business . And we expect that the take -- the increase in takeaway demand will also continue when the market starts to open up . So in total , we believe that we are well positioned to be not only strong , but maybe even stronger in the post COVID-19 situation compared to before . <p> When that is set on the forecast , we also feel confident that our long-term strategy is still the right one . And we are actually happy that it -- we did develop this strategy because it has helped us in the current situation . With the even stronger customer focus , we now manage to keep a good customer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatility in the market . So that has proven to be very important . <p> And also , the increased digitalization of our business have helped us to be able to , again , support customers and markets our products in other ways than through physical sales visits . So there were many parts of the strategy that has helped us in this situation . And we will continue to put also long-term focus on our sustainability and building together a more sustainable offer across the business . <p> And finally , as I said , we feel well positioned in the post corona area with 2 main brands . One , Duni brand that will help the restaurants and hotels to build up even more hygienic offer . And secondly , with the BioPak that can help the restaurants to increase their takeaway business . <p> And with that , I 'm handing over to Mats to talk you through the financial situation . <p> Thank you . And starting to look at the income statement where we can see that we had an operating income of SEK 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in quarter 1 2019 . So there is a drop of SEK 13 million . This drop of SEK 13 million can more than be explained by the second 2 weeks of March , where the sales were dropping . And we also had the effects of very low production volumes or even closed factories in this period to adapt to the much lower volumes that we are seeing coming through in -- as from the end of March . And also is that , as Johan have mentioned , we have the strong mitigation program , and the strong mitigation program is more or less coming into effect as from the 1st of April . So a very substantial effect at the end of March impacting the results of quarter 1 . <p> Going to the new segments , segment Duni and segment BioPak . We can see that the reduction of operating income is fully in the Duni segment . And it 's in the Duni segment that is mostly impacted by the lockdowns in Europe where , in most markets , restaurant activities are more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEK 76 million to SEK 56 million . <p> On the other hand , in BioPak , we have had a strong development throughout the quarter . And also , as Johan has also mentioned , that we see very small effects on the sales . And then at the end of March , also some positive effects for takeaway product , et cetera , starting the COVID-19 lockdowns . <p> Cash flow . We feel we enter this special period of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns in a strong position in 2019 and also during the last 12 months . We had an operating cash flow of SEK 646 million . And compared to the EBITDA , it 's very close to 100% cash conversion ratio . And this has been a focus for us during the last , I would say , 18 months to strengthen our balance sheet . And if you look into the balance sheet in -- specifically , you can see that we have a stronger position today than we had a year ago . The net sales-to-equity is -- no , the net debt-to-equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , and the net debt-to-EBITDA is 2.2 versus 3 , more or less 3 a year ago . <p> And finally , our financial targets . Sales growth , again , impacted by the very low sales we had in the last weeks of March . The operating margin at 9.4% . And as we have said , we have withdrawn -- the Board has withdrawn the recommendation to the AGM of the SEK 5 dividend per share . And instead , no dividend to be proposed to be paid during this year . <p> Starting with the SEK 150 million in cost savings as of Q2 . First of all , if you can confirm that this is sort of a year-over-year impact and if you could break it down a little bit more in terms of how much is furloughs , permanent personnel reductions , discretionary spending , et cetera , would be very helpful . <p> Yes , absolutely . This is definitely a unique activity . And of course , part of it is that we have -- are reducing costs for consultants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the main part is , of course , that we are closing down production and reducing the working time for our employees . That 's really the main part of these savings to adapt personnel to the lower volume . And that goes for both indirect personnel and direct personnel working in the factories . And the major part -- absolute major part of the personnel in Duni are impacted by work time reductions . <p> Great . And you mentioned here in the report , you see no need for additional liquidity . Could you explain a little bit on your assumptions going into that statement ? I would assume that on the long term , if you draw this on long enough , also you would have some problems . So I assume there 's some assumptions on where the market should return going into this . So if you could elaborate a bit on that , that would be helpful . <p> Yes . That 's , of course , if the lockdown would be for several years , that 's clear . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the end of the year , will start to come back slowly , we see that we have the -- absolutely the liquidity and the financing that we need . So I think -- so that 's what we can say . <p> Okay . And regarding your leverage , as I recall , you previously talked about 3x EBITDA sort of a ceiling where you would feel comfortable in terms of leverage . Is it a fair assumption that your covenants are then perhaps at 4x EBITDA or something a little bit above that ? Or how do you think we should model ? <p> Okay . Then sort of on the market share perspective , it 's been a bit of a fragmented market . I assume that some of your competitors will go out of business or at least need some type of structural actions to carry on . Where do you see -- do you see the potential here to be a little bit aggressive in terms of M&amp;A or approaching clients in a more of aggressive way ? Or how do you try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? <p> We are continuously scanning the market for opportunities . But I would be lying if I 'm saying that M&amp;A would be the main focus of our activities right now . We have now a lot of focus on making ourselves as strong as possible in this situation , and we believe there are organic opportunities for us with our offer to come out stronger . That is our main focus . <p> Right . And in terms of sort of customer -- your customers ' willingness to pay for shipped goods and credit losses and whatnot , have you seen any indications that you might see some credit losses in April or push to payment terms or so forth ? Or where are you with that right now ? <p> I think this is something that we follow very , very closely . We see as yet no major effects on this . So of course , the situation is not totally normal , but there is no major effects on this as at least not for the moment . But this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think one thing that is important to keep in mind when assessing this is that we are having most of our sales through distributors , most of them are big and strong . And we 're not really selling directly a lot to the restaurants . So that is protecting us a lot in this situation . <p> Yes . Okay . Lastly for me , I mean , there used to be a discussion on logistics cost . I guess that is a minor effect now with everything that is happening . But at the same time , e-commerce and all that distance shopping has obviously -- has accelerated through this crisis . Where do you see sort of your availability to logistics and the pricing and whatnot ? Has that had any material impact on this ? And where do you see that going forward ? <p> At the moment , we do n't see a material impact of that . Of course , there is a high volatility in many aspects of the market . So it 's , again , difficult to forecast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and we could distribute as we want to our customers , and we do n't see a big impact in terms of costs . And that is , I guess , what we can say at the moment .

Reproduction of any content for commercial purposes is subject to our usage terms and conditions , please email the editor at his address directly for clarification . <p> The Pound-Australian Dollar rate was in recovery mode Friday and is tipped to climb further up ahead following a punishing April month , with much of that decline likely to be retraced , although the levels produced in this correction could be the best available to Aussie Dollar buyers for a while to come . <p> Pound Sterling has stabilised against the Aussie and other commodity currencies following a sell-off that took the Pound-Australian Dollar rate -8% lower from peak-to-trough before culminating in rejection by the 200-day moving-average of prices that was sitting just above 1.89 on Thursday . April was characterised by a widespread recovery of risk assets including the Aussie Dollar and stock markets but an old adage says to " sell in May and go away . " <p> " We find that all G10 currencies broadly underperform through the month . As Chart 4 highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) AUD , NOK and other high beta currencies weaken the most ; b ) EUR under-performs more than GBP . This pattern of FX performance strongly suggests that May is a risk-off month , " says Kamal Sharma , a strategist at BofA Global Research . " FX volatility ( using the JPM VXY index as a proxy ) rises on average and has done so particularly in the last couple of years . " <p> The May month leaves behind the opening of a new tax year and all of the related financial flows that can help to lift risk assets and is often seen weighing on markets . Sterling is a risk asset , with an average -2.3% decline against the U.S. Dollar each year since 2010 according to BofA Global Research , although the Aussie also tends to suffer even more which means the coming weeks may see the upside correction in Pound-Australian Dollar rate extend . <p> Westpac also seems to agree . <p> " The RBA and BoE are pursuing very expansionary monetary policy and fiscal support is substantial , especially in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia 's much lower Covid-19 case count should mean a quicker restarting of economic activity in Australia . These factors should ensure AUD remains well above March lows but given our baseline view on global risk appetite , we see AUD softening to GBP 0.5050/0.5100 or AUD 1.96-1.98 multi-week , " says Westpac 's Sean Callow . <p> There 's another adage that 's also still popular with investors and which could become increasingly relevant this month ; " buy the rumour and sell the fact . " May will increasingly see major economies across Europe and North America taking steps to lift ' lockdown ' measures in place when the spread of coronavirus appeared to have been succesfully curtailed , but investors may already have squeezed the last drops from that narrative and for some it may soon seem like time for economies to actually deliver some goods . <p> Quite how quickly the global economy heaves itself up out of the coronavirus trough remains to be seen although many economists and analysts are sceptical of the earlier idea that the recovery will one day resemble a " V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would illustrate a recovery that came and went as quick as the coronavirus ' peak ' . But many investors might soon decide they need to at least see some signs of recovery being on the way before chasing risk assets any higher . <p> This could be bad news for the Aussie if profit-taking leads to falling stock markets and commodity prices . The S&amp;P 500 rose 18% last month , it 's largest gain since 1987 , and the NASDAQ technology stock index climbed 21% . These performances have left major equity benchmarks carrying only the most negligible of discounts to their New Year levels , which had seen many trade at record valuations , amid the worst economic crisis seen in living memory . <p> " The Australian dollar was the strongest G10 currency in April by a significant margin , with the NZD a distant second . So is this move justified " asks Westpac 's Robert Rennie , head of financial market strategy . " We see the recent strength in the A$ as unjustified and likely to be tested in the weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forecasting a drop to 0.62 by the end of this quarter while our fair value suggests a drop to 0.61 should be expected . " <p> The Australian Dollar rose faster than Pound Sterling in April and it could fall faster in May , which would translate into a rising Pound-Australian Dollar rate given that exchange rate always closely matches the sum of GBP/USD over AUD/USD . Westpac looks for the exchange rate to top out somewhere between 1.96 and 1.98 . Pound Sterling Live suggested in an editorial Tuesday that such a correction might lift it to somewhere between 2.00 and 2.0333 . <p> Everything remains to be determined in the month ahead but one of the few things that was clear on Friday is that as the month draws to a close the Brexit process will again impose itself on investors and traders in Pound Sterling , and the government still insists it wo n't ask for an extension of the transition period and that if the EU requests one it will say no .

With an expected economic slowdown due to COVID-19 , the Government announced the Stabilisation and Support Package ( SSP ) to support employment together with the Care and Support Package ( CSP ) to support households . <p> The SSP will continue to fund enhanced programmes such as the Jobs Support Scheme and offer improved support such as the Enhanced Wage Credit Scheme .

Discretionary support that provides unequal levels of financing and grants without considering a firm 's credit worthiness would be required to prop up these firms . <p> By contrast , key schemes in the SSP do not negate commercial discipline .

The term refers to firms that struggle for years , earning low sales , generating low growth and little meaningful employment , with little hope of resurrection , where they copy old ideas instead of pursuing innovation . <p> Many of such low-growth firms may have high debt ratios , fuelled by cheap borrowing in recent years . <p> Temporary measures such as the Job Support Scheme and Wage Credit Schemes will not keep them going after the SSP runs its course . <p> SIMILAR CHALLENGES FACED BY YOUNG , HIGH-GROWTH START-UPS <p> Young high-potential firms on the other hand may face cash flow issues in their initial years , as they pursue breaking even on their initial start-up costs , establish a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-ups in rapidly growing sectors like deep tech and artificial intelligence where sunk costs in research and development may take some time to recuperate . <p> Younger companies also tend to experience greater volatility in income compared to older firms , as they seek to grow new revenue streams and pivot their product offerings towards stronger enterprise solutions . <p> But if this higher volatility leads to higher financial costs , young and potentially high-growth firms could be wiped out along with zombie firms during a recession . <p> Fortunately , the most promising high-growth young start-ups have access to investors and government grants , through a plethora of schemes rolled out by the Government under Start-up SG . <p> The COVID-19 outbreak will pass .

Netanyahu and his rival-turned-partner , Benny Gantz , said they expected their coalition to be sworn into office next week . <p> After battling to three inconclusive elections over the past year , Netanyahu and Gantz , a former military chief , announced their " emergency " government last month , saying they would put aside their rivalry to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis . <p> Critics and good-government groups said the deal was illegal and challenged it in the Supreme Court .

The long-time leader 's opponents consider the court a bastion of democracy under dangerous assault and had expressed hope it would strike down what they see as a deal that undermines the public 's faith in government . <p> Eliad Shraga , a lawyer representing one of the petitioners against the coalition deal , expressed disappointment but said he would respect the decision .

And after March elections , a narrow majority of lawmakers endorsed him as prime minister . Gantz began preparing legislation that would have banned Netanyahu from continuing as prime minister . <p> But in a sudden about face , Gantz accepted an invitation to form a partnership with Netanyahu to confront the coronavirus crisis , infuriating many of his supporters and causing his Blue and White party to split in half . <p> Last month , the two sides agreed on a coalition deal that makes the two men equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions .

The new position will enjoy all the trappings of the prime minister , including an official residence and , key for Netanyahu , an exemption from a law that requires public officials who are not prime minister to resign if charged with a crime . <p> Netanyahu is eager to remain in office throughout his trial , using his position to lash out at the judicial system and rally support among his base .

@@71956741 <p> As everyone ponders how all economies move into the next phase of Covid-19 - some in the financial markets are starting to think about , how are the shutdowns going to be funded and what will need to be funded ? <p> There is no doubt that most Governments of the world took drastic action to protect their citizens and any cost of that protection was not considered at the time . This was an entirely appropriate response , but it will have dramatic long term implications . <p> To assess , first , let 's look at the various starting points . How much debt did countries have at the start of the crisis ? <p> The last column on the Bloomberg table below ( Figure 1 ) compares debt-to-GDP across developed markets . <p> Figure 1 : source : Bloomberg <p> These number are enormous ... and they are the starting point . <p> As a global borrower , it is important to know who owns your debt and why do they own it ? <p> In the case of Japan , ranking number one on the Bloomberg table , - a vast percentage of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , whereas in Greece , coming in second , the debt profile was owned by hedge funds and institutions , which caused much heartache for the Greek people . <h> What next ? <p> All governments will need to issue debt to fund their obligations to their citizens . When you read " citizens " intellectually substitute the word " voters " , because the present crisis might be a circumstance where " I vote , I need work " could be the next bumper sticker . <p> In order to imagine how governments can respond to voter concerns , it might be best to understand what they themselves will be dealing with . <p> Debt to GDP is the countries ' debt ( numerator ) as a percentage of GDP ( denominator ) . What should analysts assume the denominator will look like for 2020 ? What about even 2021 right through to 2025 ? There are over 30 million unemployed in the US in one month . <p> Who can , with complete confidence , decide what the GDP will look like forany country ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is that no one really knows at what velocity ; what will the bounce in activity look like ? Will consumers consume , comfortable that all will be good , no recurrence in pandemics , and that companies will continue to put employee and customer welfare before profits ? <p> I think it is reasonable to presume the denominator will struggle to grow for the foreseeable future , remembering for most investors a month can hold a lifetime of investing experiences , so a five year horizon is the equivalent of a Star Trek light year . <h> The numerator <p> This is where the rubber really hits the road because we have been told by Treasury what to expect for upcoming issuance . <p> The US Treasury announced on 6 May , that its funding requirement for the next quarter is $96 Billion , for one quarter ! By President Trump 's own estimate they have the economy contracting this year by 40% ; the American deficit will groan onwards to $4 trillion . These numbers are easy to write but nearly impossible to comprehend . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment - then overlay it , with the needs of Europe , Japan , China , Latin America and the rest of the world . <h> Why does funding deficits matter ? <p> America , particularly under Donald Trump 's leadership , is not a " cap in hand " borrower . There seems to be very little diplomacy . Think back to the GFC and then Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson flying to China to assure the Chinese investors that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would redeem their debts even if the government had to step in . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the funding entities that provide funding for mortgages in the US . <p> There is no evidence on the surface that America recognises that it might have any challenge funding $4 trillion in debt ... remember those debt ceiling arguments during the Obama Administration ? <p> If there is an investor boycott in any form , then we could see a significant steepening of the bond curve ... " Houston , we have a problem ! " , America will either cut spending , hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or pay the higher coupon on the bond and hope the economy rebounds , which is assuming a very weak US Dollar . <p> I do n't like any of those strategies and this is all based on the assumption that $4 trillion is enough to kick start an economy that was n't increasing in headline revenue prior to the Covid-19 pandemic . <h> What do investors do ? <p> Australia is not in as precarious a situation as most other countries , as Figure 1 highlights . <p> I do n't provide advice , personal , investment or otherwise . With these circumstances , I can see a situation that investors may need to take different risks where cash rates are so low predominantly in the short end . Investors who decide to buy long dated government bonds will have revalue risk . The theory is if rates go higher after you invest , there will be a capital loss if you sell that bond in the market . This is a critical issue for fund managers , but if rates in the short end go to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savers . <p> Therefore , it could be valuable to decide if a part of your portfolio is dedicated to income , and if so , is there a long-dated bond that can meet your requirements ? <p> Again on the premise that I do n't provide any advice , but discern as a keen observer , I would watch to see how markets are responding to the increased issuance - and if you can achieve a compelling rate taking Australian government risk , then it is at least worth exploring through your own independent research or via a fund manager . <p> Mark Todd <p> Head of Fixed Income , Bank of China <p> Bank of China has a commercial interest ( in the assets ) printed in this article . <p> Bank of China does not provide investment or personal advice . <p> Investors should seek its own independent and appropriate advice that is suitable for their investment needs .	
@@51719441 <p> OTTAWA --When Paul MacLellan first heard the government was going to give seniors up to $500 to help with the rising costs of COVID-19 , he said he was " excited . " <p> Now , two weeks after the announcement and with no timeline of when he can expect the funds , MacLellan and others like him say they feel like they 've been left on the back burner . <p> " It really comes down to paying bills , because I think a lot of seniors , whether they want to admit it or not , we 're in debt .

Even if they did it quarterly it would help , during this time . But I 'd like to see the first one , to begin with . " <p> The government announced on May 12 that eligible seniors would receive a one time , tax-free payment of up to $500 to help them cope with rising costs amid the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> Any senior who is eligible for the Old Age Security ( OAS ) pension is supposed to receive a $300 payment . An additional $200 is slated to be sent to seniors eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement ( GIS ) . No application is required to receive this one-time payment . <p> The Government of Canada website lays out the details for the new payment for seniors , but where it lists its date of payment , there 's only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . " <p> Speaking to CTVNews.ca , Scott Bardsley , a spokesperson for Seniors Minister Deb Schulte , said that the payments will be sent out " within weeks , not months . " <p> " It certainly wo n't be two months , " he said . " We do n't have the exact date , and we 're going to get that out as soon as we can . " <p> With little information coming from the government , many seniors guessed that this payment would coincide with May 's OAS pension deposit . However , they were dismayed to find there was nothing extra when the money landed in their accounts Tuesday night . <p> " I did get my OAS payment today , but I did n't get the extra $300 which is what I was expecting . I thought this would have been the easy fix for them to get it out , " Janet Clarke , a 70 year old from Brantford , told CTVNews.ca . <p> Clarke said she did n't understand why the money was rolling out so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canada Emergency Response Benefit ( CERB ) . <p> The CERB , which was announced on March 25 , opened for applications on April 6 , and saw payments delivered to bank accounts within 10 days . <p> " Everything else that they said they 're going to do came out very quickly . " <p> " I feel as a senior that we 're not as important ... Do n't tell us you 're going to give us this , and then do n't give it to us , " Clarke said . <p> When CTVNews.ca asked Bardsley about these concerns , he explained that the OAS database is half a century old and uses outdated technology -- something the government was planning to upgrade this December . <p> He also noted that the government gave a round of support to " over four million " seniors in April through the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) credit , which he said " pays an average of $375 to single seniors and $510 to senior couples .

The contrast between the APA 's enforced values and those of the " Bible Belt " states are so great that I can see something similar to Osteopathic Medicine arising and being legislatively accepted as an alternative accreditation .

Did the enrollment numbers come back with the economy -- or did law schools remain smaller than they had been circa 2008 ? <p> Undergrad did n't -- over the past 8 years , undergrad enrollment nationally has fallen 11% . It 's predicted to continue to decline and then plummet in 2026 -- this all is demographics and the number of 18-year olds in the country ( 2008+18=2026 ) . <p> While we have had alternating big &amp; small generations ever since the Civil War , there were few children born during the Depression and then a *lot* during the Baby Boom -- and the Millennials are the children of the Baby Boomers , while Gen X were the children of those born during the Depression ( Silent Generation ) and Gen Z are their children .

( China was already in the midst of a major recession prior to the Wuhan Virus . ) <p> Some predict that upwards of *half* of the existing colleges and universities will close in the next 10 years -- and that likely will apply to law schools as well . It 's a simple case of bodies and money , bodies to put into the seats and those bodies having the money to pay ever-increasing tuition -- and a shortage of both . <p> I think the ROI on a top-tier law school is worth it if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associate position with the large salary out of law school ( or a clerkship ) . Or if you just have the money to spend and would like the experience . <p> In my own experience , I was accepted into , and graduated from , a Top14 law school ( not sure why they cut off at 14 , maybe because of ties ? ) , and paid full freight ( well , borrowed $125k for the 3 years , and paid it back with interest after 12 years ) . But I had also been offered a full scholarship to Notre Dame 's law school . At 21 , I of course wanted to go to the better law school , and went into debt to do so . And while I have enjoyed the respect I receive among local lawyers when they ask what law school I attended , I 'm certainly not earning any more than my colleagues who attended a Tier 2 or 3 school .

Within 100 miles from my town , there are probably At least 5-7 really bad law schools ( who accept anyone ) and their tuition costs are insane . Many of their students do n't even graduate , and those that do have like a 20% Bar pass rate , and thus they are enticing people to go $150,000 in debt for an almost worthless product , where most of the students will never actually practice law , but will have a lifetime of non-dischargeable , six-figure debt to deal with . <p> We will see how the Coronavirus and the economic fallout affects the legal job market in the medium term , but until the virus hit , this was the best time in a long time , maybe ever , to attend law school . Applicant pool still well below the peak , and law schools offering generous scholarships . So you could still get into a " better " law school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . And if you are willing to go to a lower rank law school -- say you got into Duke , but you were willing to go to your home state school of Indiana-Bloomington ( still a fine school ) , you could likely go for free or close to it . <p> First , the " maybe ever " part was silly . Perhaps even so silly it was a botched attempt at sarcasm ? <p> My recollection of the ' 90s is that that period was very good for law graduates , too . I have n't been involved in hiring lawyers since 2004 but I suspect the market was better than that it is now , also . <p> this was the best time in a long time , maybe ever , to attend law school . <p> Many people are saying that there has never been a better time in all of history to attend law school .

Millions and millions of young beautiful kids are going to law school and making more money than any profession has ever made . <p> Job market was quite good pre-Corona . Not as good as the late 90s , for example , but you have to think of it this way : Let 's say 70% of the class at Georgetown gets jobs at firms paying 200K , and Boston College 35% . In 1998 , you would get a relatively " better " job in terms of pay , promotion , etc. from Georgetown . But in 2018 , you were more likely to get into Georgetown to begin with ; in 1998 you might have been at BC with the same credentials . ( These are just hypos , the ease of getting in has actually eased up more at lower-ranked schools ) . Or you could go to BC at a huge discount in 2018 and be more likely to be near the top of the class .

I saw somewhere that average tuition at a *private* school , not sticker price , but what 's actually being charged , is something like 18K a year . That 's less than my last year of law school cost 30 years ago . <p> It 's not so much of interest that schools will open in the fall , of course they will , like all grade and high schools . But what percent will be foreign students , particularly the Chinese , paying full price , that colleges depend on to balance their budgets ? That 's the interesting question . <p> When I was in graduate school recently , the Chinese yanked the rug out from under my university about a reciprocity program . They were banking on tons of Chinese students paying full price to make up their budget gap . Of course , these students were going to take slots from taxpaying in-state citizens . <p> One professor said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Chinese want the STEM expertise the university provides but without the social sciences ( and associated luggage ) reciprocity that the university put into the deal . I ca n't say I blame them . <p> 1 . No , there is not a complete ABA-accredited monopoly . That said , the vast majority of states either require it , or the path without it is onerous ( IIRC , Virginia allows you to " apprentice , " Mass. has non-accredited schools , and California , famously , has the " Baby Bar " ) . Given the great disparity in the level of practice you will normally see , graduating from an ABA law school AND passing the bar is the bare minimum , and usually indicates that the person in question can breathe with their mouth closed . Sometimes . <p> 2. " until the virus hit , this was the best time in a long time , maybe ever , to attend law school " <p> I do n't even . Things have certainly trended up since law schools ( and the graduates , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things have gotten better in the last , oh , six years or so " is hardly the same ringing endorsement . <p> If you get into a T15 , it 's a good investment .

Otherwise , caveat emptor . <p> " I saw somewhere that average tuition at a *private* school , not sticker price , but what 's actually being charged , is something like 18K a year . That 's less than my last year of law school cost 30 years ago . " <p> Prof. Bernstein teaches at George Mason , which is a good public law school . That said .... the non-discounted cost to attend ( 2018 start ) is $190k ( non-resident , assume out of state ) . If you are one of the people that GMU is paying full freight , that 's a good deal !

Good for them . <p> There are SO MANY WORSE SCHOOLS . So look at those numbers ... the good numbers , from a good school . <p> P.S. Our target enrollment , and basically our average enrollment , before the post-Great Recession bust was 220 . The year we took in 300 was an anomaly , it was either 2010 or 11 , and every other law school had a big drop in matriculation , but we were oversubscribed , only to get slammed like everyone else the following year . It 's now been ranging between 150 and 180 , we have cut our class size just like many other law school -- but not by half . <p> A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools these days , are getting discounts . Of course , the worse your job prospects are from a school , the less payoff you get from law school , though your opportunity cost may be lower . I do n't count living costs as a cost of law school unless going to law school involves moving out of your parents house , where your bills are all paid . After all , you have to pay for housing , rent , food , etc. whether you are in law school or not . The real additional cost of law schools is your opportunity cost of whatever job you would be holding those three years ( or whatever else you would be doing ) .

Not only rulers the perspectives of subjects about the development have also changed . Most people now think like their rulers . For them , the strong defense system means progress . This concept has flourished in every country and resultantly entire world is engaged in an arms race . With this escalation of the arms race , human development has been pushed aside . <p> Studies show world military budget grew to $1.8 trillion in 2018 . US military spending spiked by 4.6 percent to reach $649 billion , followed by China that increased its military expenditure by 5 percent to $250 billion . Indian defense budget also witnesses a year-on-year increase . Though this year 's ( 2020 ) military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.71 trillion rupees . Pakistan decided to announce the austerity-driven defense budget but at the end of the day , there was no change as compared to the previous year . The amount allocated was around 1.15 trillion rupees . This data explicitly indicates how the race for arms build-up is rising in the world . Such a huge amount is spent just for ambitions of power and the next reason is the rivalry between the nations . <p> Since lust for power is inherent to man , thus war has its history . In all times , wars have occurred . And , we can not say the future would be without war and in this background , some experts legitimate the arms race . Some people believe that the arms race can help in the prevention of war . So , the defense and war-prevention are two most used excuses to justify the arms -- race . <p> But , this again negates the fact that we are modern and civilized .

It is not up to standard on the part of a man who talks much about social , cultural , moral progression and their importance , to hold an imperialistic mindset . Our claim that education enlightens our life crumbles down when an ' educated rulers ' prefer to rule with an iron fist . It also renders the concept of ' Democracy ' meaningless . <p> One may argue if not war , security is still imperative for the country as fundamentalists and radical elements exist everywhere and this calls for military development . Agreed , but in doing so we must not forget the basic essentialities of our life . <p> One can easily glean from the current situation how the rulers have worked for people 's quality of life and social progress to date .

A common man thinks how better it would have been if the armed race had been replaced by the ' Human-development race ' . If we had focused much on human welfare rather than on weaponry or even if our work would have been priority-based- more human less military-centric the world would not have been going through tragic times . <p> We can not ignore the fact , that the current crisis is a bolt from the blue and it has beaten even the best healthcare systems .

Here 's what a second round of stimulus might entail . <p> A Fool since 2010 , and a graduate from UC San Diego with a B.A. in Economics , Sean specializes in the healthcare sector and investment planning . You 'll often find him writing about Obamacare , marijuana , drug and device development , Social Security , taxes , retirement issues and general macroeconomic topics of interest . Follow @TMFUltraLong <p> It 's been nearly two months since Congress passed and the president signed the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act into law . At $2.2 trillion , it 's the largest relief package ever passed by Congress -- albeit it 's designed to tackle a never-before-seen problem like the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , which has cost an estimated 36 million people their jobs over an eight-week stretch . <p> Although the CARES Act provided funds for hospitals , distressed industries , small business loans , and for the expansion of the unemployment benefits program , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus payments to American workers and seniors . <p> Image source : Getty Images . <p> According to the Treasury Department , more than 150 million people are eligible for an Economic Impact Payment , as these stimulus payouts are officially known . Based on fairly recent data , the Internal Revenue Service had disbursed almost 130 million payments totaling $218 billion . <p> At their maximum , these Economic Impact Payments could total $1,200 per individual or $2,400 for a married couple filing jointly . Additionally , qualifying dependents aged 16 and under can add $500 to what their parent or household will receive . Thus , a married couple filing jointly with three young children could collect $3,900 in stimulus money . To qualify for this maximum payout , a single , married , or head-of-household tax filer would need to have earned less than $75,000 , $150,000 , and $112,500 , respectively , in adjusted gross income ( AGI ) in their most recent tax filing . <p> There 's absolutely no question that this stimulus money was needed by recipients to buy essential goods and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains that this stimulus money did n't even last a month for approximately three-quarters of recipients . A second round of stimulus is very much needed , and new proposals on what this second package should look like are popping up all over Washington , D.C. <p> Here are seven of the most prominent proposals , so far , for what the second stimulus package should look like ( not listed in any particular order ) . <p> Image source : Getty Images . <h> 1 . Emergency Money for the People Act <p> First up is the Emergency Money for the People Act , introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna ( D-Calif. ) and Rep. Tim Ryan ( D-Ohio ) . The goal of this second stimulus proposal would be to provide up to $2,000 in monthly payouts to individuals , or up to $4,000 monthly to couples filing jointly , for a period of one year . Single and married filers with incomes below $130,000 and $260,000 , respectively , would qualify for this second round of stimulus . <p> Similar to the CARES Act , dependents could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives , albeit there would be a three-dependent limit . However , unlike the CARES Act , dependents aged 17 and over can qualify to provide a parent or household with this $500 kicker. <h> 2 . Getting America Back to Work Act <p> Although a majority of these proposals are from Democrats , the Getting America Back to Work Act comes from Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri . The idea here is to provide a refundable payroll tax rebate that 'll cover up to 80% of employer payroll costs , applicable up to the median wage . Even though this is n't going to put money into the pockets of working Americans , it 's going to lower costs for employers to retain their staff and presumably make it easier for businesses to ramp up activity once states are fully open again . <h> 3 . Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act <p> The Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act , as the name implies , aims to legally allow renters and lenders to forgo their housing payments for one year without it adversely affecting their credit scores . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would instruct the Department of Housing and Urban Development to create a fund that 'd be responsible for paying landlords and mortgage holders to help cover their lost rental and mortgage payments . <p> Image source : Getty Images . <h> 4 . Sen. Sherrod Brown 's call for quarterly direct stimulus payments <p> According to Ohio news station WLWT , Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D-Ohio ) plans to propose a second stimulus package that would pay $2,000 per individual every quarter . This echoes a proposal that Brown and a few colleagues introduced in March prior to the passage of the CARES Act , which called for an initial payment of $2,000 , a potential second payment of $1,500 , and , if needed , quarterly payouts of $1,000 per person . <p> Brown 's quarterly payout proposal is unique in that most existing stimulus efforts call for a monthly payment . <h> 5 . HEROES Act <p> The 1,815-page Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act , or HEROES Act , has been getting a lot of attention lately . Coming in at a $3 trillion cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from providing $1 trillion to states , $200 billion to provide hazard pay to essential workers , and extending unemployment benefit protections through January 2021 ( the extra $600 per week is set to end after July 31 , 2020 ) , it would also provide up to $1,200 per taxpayer and up to $6,000 per household . <p> While the payouts per individual and income eligibility requirements are the same as under the CARES Act , dependents are each worth up to $1,200 in added payout , rather than $500 , with a limit of three dependents . Thus , a married couple filing jointly with three kids can net up $6,000 , as opposed to $3,900 under the CARES Act . <p> Additionally , dependents of all ages , not just those aged 16 and under , would qualify their parent or household for this extra $1,200 ( up to the limit of three dependents ) . <p> The HEROES Act was passed in the House by a relatively party-line vote of 217 in favor to 189 opposed last Friday , May 15 .

Automatic Boost to Communities Act <p> Another proposal making its rounds in Washington , D.C. , is the Automatic Boost to Communities ( ABC ) Act , which was introduced by Rashida Tlaib ( D-Mich. ) and Pramila Jayapal ( D-Wash . ) . Under the ABC Act , individuals would receive $2,000 monthly during a defined payment period ( lasting at least a year ) , with U.S. citizens , residents , and nonresident aliens in the country for at least three months all eligible for the payout . Making nonresident aliens eligible is what really allows the ABC Act to stand out from a crowded field of proposals . <p> It should also be noted that dependents would add $2,000 each during this initial payment period . Thus , a couple with two children would receive a whopping $8,000 monthly payment . <p> Furthermore , the ABC Act provides a recurring payout of $1,000 per eligible individual ( and a $1,000 kicker for each dependent ) for one year following the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would last two years . <p> Payments could be made traditionally ( e.g. , via direct deposit ) or with a BOOST prepaid debit card for those without a bank account . <h> 7 . Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act <p> Finally , the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act , introduced by Senators Kamala Harris ( D-Calif ) , Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , and Ed Markey ( D-Mass. ) , aims to provide eligible individuals with $2,000 per month , or $4,000 for couples filing jointly . Like the ABC Act , it would also allow the addition of $2,000 to what a parent or household receives on a monthly basis per qualified dependent , up to a limit of three dependents . Under this scenario , a married couple with three children would receive up to $10,000 monthly . These payments would continue until three months after the coronavirus emergency has ended . <p> Under the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act , single , married , and head-of-household filers with AGI 's over $100,000 , $200,000 , and $150,000 would respectively see reduced payouts .

@@51589641 <p> TORONTO -- Morgan Rielly has been working out at home trying to stay in shape . <p> The Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman is also reading , watching movies and improving his rudimentary cooking skills . He 's fairly confident with the barbecue and has a decent handle on pasta . <p> " I do n't have the confidence yet for fish , " Rielly said . " I do n't want to under-cook it ... then we 've got a whole other situation on our hands . " <p> And when there 's quiet moments -- there 's been , quite frankly , a lot of those -- he 's reflected on Toronto 's rollercoaster campaign that screeched to a halt when the NHL suspended its season March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> A few weeks before the pause , Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas used the words " Jekyll and Hyde " to describe his team . <p> On some nights , they were world-beaters with a high-flying roster consisting of Auston Matthews , Mitch Marner and William Nylander up front , Rielly leading from the back end , and Frederik Andersen in goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired Mike Babcock as head coach in November and could seemingly almost do no wrong . <p> And then there were times following that somewhat expected surge when basic breakouts or defensive zone coverages looked like advanced algebra . <p> Rielly sat out 23 games with a broken foot he suffered blocking a shot in Florida on Jan. 12 in an 8-4 loss -- one of many low points in the New Year . <p> He then watched emergency backup goalie David Ayres become an international celebrity when the Carolina Hurricanes embarrassed Toronto 6-3 at home on Feb. 22 , and was on the road to witness the Leafs gain a solitary point against the San Jose Sharks , Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks -- who just happen to be the three worst teams in the Western Conference . <p> Despite having a lot of information , Rielly still has few answers . <p> " I ca n't really put my finger on it , " he said on a conference call with reporters Thursday . " It 's important that we use this down time to really take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have to be better . <p> " If you look at the ups and the downs , that 's obviously not how you want your year to be described . " <p> Rielly returned to the lineup two days before the novel coronavirus outbreak forced the NHL 's hand , playing more than 21 minutes in a gritty 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning . <p> The Leafs , who were 36-25-9 and in a post-season spot at the time the league went on hiatus , seemed to play up or down to the opposition 's level throughout 2019-20 , which is a problem for a team that once again started training camp with Stanley Cup aspirations . <p> " You want it to be a bit more consistent , " Rielly said . " But with the bad there 's always good . We answered the bell at times when we had to against some pretty good teams . And then the downs being the games where you 're supposed to win or you really expect a good team to be able to win , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to take it personally . " <p> On that personal side , 26-year-old was n't all that pleased with his play before getting cut down by injury . <p> He led all Toronto defencemen three goals and 27 points in 46 games , averaging a team-high 24:15 of ice time per night . <p> But due to an unspecified physical ailment and some inconsistent performances , there were stretches where he looked like a shadow of the player who set career-highs with 20 goals , 52 assists and 72 points in 2018-19 . Those 20 goals were the most among NHL defenceman last season , while the points total ranked third overall and fifth all-time for a Toronto blue-liner . <p> " There were times where I was good , " Rielly said of his 2019-20 . " And I think that there were times where I felt that I could have done better . <p> " That 's a bit how we as a team look back at the year . " <p> And even though it was brief , he 's thankful to have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot . <p> " When you 're training in the gym and trying to get back to play , you 're picturing playing 12 , 13 games and playing in playoffs , not playing one ( game ) , " Rielly said . " I 'm happy I played one because I think I 'd be going crazy if I had n't played since January . " <p> Rielly flew home to North Vancouver , B.C. , after the NHL allowed players to relocate away from their team 's cities last month , and is spending time with girlfriend and Olympic figure skating champion Tessa Virtue in self-isolation . <p> " We 're both in it together , " said Rielly , who 's usually loathe to discuss himself in public . " We 're trying to keep each other sane and we 're doing what we can to do our part and just quarantine ... I 'm glad I 'm not alone because I think that can be challenging . <p> " It 's important to keep in touch with those people in your life . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic changed life as he and the rest of us know it are chats with teammates about a season that may never end -- the NHL could return later in the spring or summer , or perhaps not until the 2020-21 campaign in the fall -- and process how it played out . <p> " You reflect and you picture things going differently , " Rielly said .

@@84847441 <h> Home Quarantine Using Face Recognition <p> The title might seem a bit confusing but I 'll explain . Face Recognition for Home Quarantine is a smart system that restricts other people from entering your home without permission . It works by recognizing a face and allows only family members . The device also provides hand automatic sanitization of that person . <p> First of all , let 's gather the components required for the project . <h> Bill Of Material <h> Prerequisites <p> I hope you already have the Raspberry Pi board ready with the latest Raspbian OS so that we can install the required modules and libraries . Open the Linux terminal and the install the following libraries <p> dlib <p> Opencv <p> numpy <p> Scipy <p> Matplot <p> Facerecognition <p> Keras <p> Or you can use the following command to install the library : <p> sudo pip install library name <p> sudo apt-get update <p> sudo apt-get upgrade <p> sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile <p> Then change the line CONFSWAPSIZE=100 to CONFSWAPSIZE=1024 <p> sudo **26;1624;TOOLONG stop <p> sudo **26;1652;TOOLONG start <p> sudo pip3 install opencv <p> sudo pip3 install numpy <p> wget https : **30;1680;TOOLONG <p> pip3 install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gpiozero , espeak and ultrasonic libraries . <p> After that , we can now start our coding . <h> Coding for Home Quarantine Using Face Recognition <p> First , create a new project folder and copy into it the images of family members who are allowed to enter the house . Now rename those images with the original name of the family members . Next , create a new Python file . Here I have created a Python file named " Home.py " . Open this file in PYTHON IDE and then create the code as described . <p> First , import the required libraries in the code and then define the servo motor GPIO pin with its min and max angle . After that , define the ultrasonic sensor pin number . Here we are using pin nos. 27 and 22 . ( Refer Fig 1 ) <p> Fig 1 <p> Next , we will set the image file name within the list of family members allowed to enter the house in the quarantine period . This code will then analyse the face of the person on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of allowed family members , then the system will request to sanitize themselves before entering the house . It will then check the ultrasonic sensor reading using an if() condition . So , if the distance between the hands and the sanitizing tap/nozzle is below the threshold , then the sensor will get to know that someone has placed their hands near the tap/nozzle . After this , the tap/nozzle valve will open to allow sanitization . <p> It counts for 30 seconds so that person is sanitized thoroughly . By moving the servo to an open position , that person can be allowed entry into the house , hospital , or office . ( Refer Fig 2 . ) <p> Fig 2Fig 3 <h> Connection <p> Now connect the components as described in the circuit diagram . <p> Connection diagram Created in Fritzing <h> Testing for Home Quarantine Using Face Recognition <p> After powering the Raspberry Pi and other components , run the code that we have written and wait a few seconds for the camera window to open . When ready , the camera window will show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . If it detects the person as a family member , then it will automatically ask you to sanitize your hand . To do so , the person has to place their hands near the ultrasonic sensor for them to be detected . Then the sanitizer will be sprayed onto your hands and will count to 30 seconds so that the hands get sanitized well . After that , the servo motor will move to unlock position , thus allowing you to enter the house .	
@@85022941 <h> Shopping for Makeup Post COVID-19 Lockdown Will Never Be the Same <p> There are virtual try-ons , color descriptions , and customer reviews to help you buy a new foundation online . However , none of these tools can ever compare to an in-store makeup shopping experience . <p> Swatching your wrist with a foundation tester and actually applying it to your skin is a foolproof way to find the perfect shade and formula for you .

As of May 22 , the decision to keep and regulate makeup testers in stores is left up to the retailers themselves . <p> That being said , mass retailers , department stores , and boutiques are not taking the safety and hygiene of their customers and employees lightly . <p> " As we continue to reopen our doors to customers , more than anything , we want our customers and employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schlitt , Nordstrom national beauty director .

" I have a few ideas , but I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my idea is going to be relatively going to be expensive if it comes into fruition , " explains Jessica Richards , founder of SHEN Beauty . " There 's also talk of brands providing one-time use testers for stores . But what about the smaller brands that ca n't afford to make them ? Those are mostly the brands I work with . " <p> While mass retailers may axe testers for all categories , boutiques might still allow them for skincare and body samples , but you wo n't be able to dispense them yourself . " Skincare and body care have pumps and you can drop it into the customer 's hands , but it 's the makeup that 's concerning , " Richards says . <p> Another option is offering take-home samples , which is what Nordstrom is doing . <h> Expect More Virtual Try-On Experiences <p> In lieu of in-store testers , some retailers are ramping up their digital try-on experiences .

Nordstrom 's also going one step further to pause all waxing , nail , and spa services . <p> On the other hand , Ulta is suspending brow and skin services , but will continue offer hair services in select locations .

" We frequently clean and disinfect between each appointment and throughout the day ; and salons are operating with limited capacity to help maintain social distancing where possible . " <p> As for boutiques like SHEN Beauty that offer facials , waxing , makeup , and brow services , they will require their employees to have elevated training . Richards says that she is asking her staff to complete BARBICIDE training every six months , in addition to any other relevant teachings . <p> " My employee that does microblading and I were discussing how he may have to take an additional course once we can offer the service again , " she says . " Since microblading creates a wound , it may need to be wrapped up afterwards like having a fresh tattoo wrapped in plastic because the virus is airborne .

While I have assumed an incubation period of 6 days ( again , this is considered the median incubation period ) , the incubation period for coronavirus cases is currently estimated between 2 and 14 days . <p> But I think it does give a pretty good indication of the effectiveness of the restrictions themselves . <p> Blocking arrivals from Iran , South Korea , and Italy , for instance , likely went some way towards reducing imported coronavirus cases from certain ' coronavirus hotspots ' around the world , but others were still being imported undetected from countries like the United States . <p> The Stage 1 and Stage 2 restrictions enforced by the Federal Government , on the other hand , appear to have had a much more significant impact . These involved strict social distancing rules , and the closure of various venues such as gyms . <h> Coronavirus cases by state <p> The bulk of Australia 's coronavirus cases are located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus cases has remained steady at approximately 45% between 16 March 2020 and 5 April 2020 , growing from 134 cases to 2,580 cases in that time . <p> Data Source : Australian Government , Chart : Author <p> Pleasingly , however , each of Australia 's states and territories are now taking more than 6 days to double their cases . The big outlier is Northern Territory , which is experiencing case growth of 86% every 6 days , although that is off a much smaller base ( it had just 26 recorded cases on Sunday 5 April , compared to 14 cases 6 days earlier ) . Victoria is experiencing the next highest rate of 6-day growth at 38% , followed by New South Wales at 35% . <p> The rate of daily growth , on the other hand , has slowed to low single digits . While that does not welcome complacency ( more on that in a moment ) , it is a very pleasing statistic . <p> Data Source : Australian Government , Table : Author <h> Testing for coronavirus <p> When we talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often overlooked is the number of tests being conducted . Without testing , a country could , theoretically , claim to have no official coronavirus cases . <p> Likewise , without testing the entire population regularly , there is no way of knowing exactly how many actual coronavirus cases there are . Hence , it is likely there are many , many more individuals who have coronavirus and are showing only very mild symptoms , or perhaps none at all , who are not included in the country 's official coronavirus cases . <p> In many ways , it is those individuals who we need to be most careful to avoid . Ironically , they are the ones who are more difficult to detect , hence the importance of the government 's strict social distancing rules ( that way , we avoid becoming infected from people who may not even know they are infected ) . <p> According to the Federal Government , 297,000 tests had been conducted by 5 April . That represents a testing rate of approximately 11.6 tests per 1,000 people in Australia , with 1 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That is a high rate of testing by international standards . According to Worldometers , the testing rate in Italy and Germany is roughly 10.9 tests per 1,000 people , while the United States has tested approximately 4.9 per 1,000 people . <p> As at 5 April 2020 , more than 56,000 tests had been conducted in Victoria , and 121,443 tests had been conducted in New South Wales . <p> On a per capita basis , South Australia and New South Wales appear to be doing the most testing ( 19.8 tests per 1,000 people , 16.6 tests per 1,000 people respectively ) . <p> Based on testing figures from the Federal Government , Victoria , Tasmania and Western Australia have conducted less than 10 tests per 1,000 population . <h> However ... <p> It is also important to note that Australia 's rate of testing has not been scaled up . In 3 of the past 4 days , between 6,000 and 7,000 tests have been conducted each day , compared to more than 10,000 daily tests which were being conducted each day late in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected each day recently may also be a function of lower testing . <p> Again , this suggests that the number of Australian coronavirus cases is likely much higher than the official number suggests . <h> No reason to become complacent <p> Indeed , there are many reasons to be positive about the declining growth in coronavirus cases , and also about Australia 's low fatality rate ( currently 0.6% ) . <p> But these positive outcomes have also raised certain doubts from some corners of the community . Namely , some people wonder : 1 ) whether the restrictions enforced by the federal and state governments were an overreaction ; and 2 ) whether things will go back to ' normal ' in the next few weeks . <p> In my opinion , the answer to both those questions is ' No ' . <p> To the first question , here 's an analogy . If you outlay for house insurance and , after 20 years , your house has n't burned down , was buying the insurance an overreaction ? <p> Without these restrictions , the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are experiencing now . In a recent interview , Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that without these measures , a further 5,000 Australians would have been infected with coronavirus . <p> By my numbers ( based on the growth in cases that Australia was experiencing ) , I would suggest that number would have been closer to an additional 10,000 . <p> At that stage , our hospitals would more than likely have already become overwhelmed , and our fatality rate would likely have been much higher ( due to many individuals not receiving the level of care required ) . <p> To the second question , growth in coronavirus cases is slowing . But as I alluded to above , there are likely still many cases that have gone undetected in the community . <p> The chart below , from the Australian Government , shows the source of COVID-19 transmission by state and territory . The light blue bars and the grey bars , which appear to add to around 600 -- 700 cases in aggregate , are either under investigation or locally acquired from an unknown source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Source : Australian Government . <p> Indeed , overseas acquired cases represented the bulk of Australia 's new cases in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak . Now that that source of infection has slowed dramatically ( due to travel bans ) , new cases appear to be mostly from within the community . <p> Hence , local transmission still represents a large threat , and could result in an increase in cases growth if individuals begin to become complacent . <p> The chart below shows a hypothetical scenario whereby all restrictions were removed today . It assumes a 3% rate of new case growth for 5 days , with growth then gradually increasing to 20% per day in 15 days . <p> Given the rates of growth experienced in recent weeks in Australia , and the rates of growth experienced internationally , that does not seem like an unreasonable expectation . <p> Chart : Author <p> The chart is shown on a logarithmic scale . Again , assuming all restrictions were relaxed , we could theoretically be adding more than 100,000 cases per day by 12 May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too abruptly , is by no means in our best interests . <h> How is the share market holding up ? <p> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index ( ASX : XJO ) soared last week , and has continued to recover ground this morning . At time of writing , the market has risen 127 points or 2.5% to 5,194 points . The Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( ASX : CBA ) share price is up 2.6% . <p> Personally , I feel the best way for investors to approach this market is with caution . Volatility levels have certainly declined , but that does n't mean there wo n't be more bad news , and that can certainly impact share prices . <p> Hence , perhaps the best way to buy into shares is by taking small nibbles , particularly in businesses you feel are well equipped to handle the current crisis . Strong balance sheets are a must in this climate , while those businesses that are able to continue operating mostly through remote work are ideal . <p> For instance , many cloud-based businesses such as Elmo Software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASX : BTH ) have both adapted to remote work . <p> On the other hand , companies such as Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd ( ASX : FLT ) have been forced to make massive cost reductions and participate in heavily dilutive equity raises . With a highly uncertain outlook in the travel sector , I 'm certainly not investing in that space right now . <h> Foolish bottom line <p> A picture is worth a thousand words and whilst the charts above demonstrate that we are making progress in the fight against COVID-19 , the battle is not yet over . Scott Morrison has suggested that we get used to the idea of these heavy restrictions for 6 months . Despite the pleasing progress that has been made , you should n't expect those restrictions to be lifted any time soon . <p> This should also influence your investing perspective .

@@71774041 <h> DILG deploys cops to keep students out of malls , movie houses , other crowded places <p> The Department of Interior and Local Government ( DILG ) has ordered the police , local government units ( LGU ) executives , and barangays officials to keep students out of malls , movie houses , market places , and other crowded places to prevent them from contracting the dreaded coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) . <p> The DILG issued the directive following President Duterte 's declaration of class suspension in the entire Metro Manila from March 10-14 . <p> " The President has directed all local officials in NCR from mayor down to punong barangays as well as all units of the Philippine National Police ( PNP ) to ensure that no children are seen loitering around and , if they are seen , they are to be immediately sent home to do their homework , " said DILG Secretary Eduardo M. A ? o . <p> He appealed for the cooperation of all parents to discipline and closely supervise their children and ensure that they stay home and do their homework instead of going out to gallivant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ang , the DepEd said it will give home assignments or performance tasks to all students so that they will have something productive to do during this period , " A ? o said . <p> He explained that allowing students to roam in public places will defeat the very purpose of the class suspension which is preemptive social distancing to slow down the spread of the virus . <p> " Our police officers and the barangay officials will serve as truant officers to ensure that kids stay at home . I have also directed all our Metro Manila Mayors to personally direct their respective Chiefs of Police to implement the presidential directive so that local governments and the police will jointly implement this policy of the government , " he added . <p> He also instructed all Metro Manila LGUs to suspend or postpone all mass gatherings in the meantime as another pre-emptive social distancing measure . <p> " I can not overemphasize the role of the punong barangays in NCR . They have to be pro-active in their respective barangays , " he said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health demands it . Together with sustained hygiene ( like regular hand washing , coughing etiquette , thermo scans and face masks ) , suspensions of classes , and mass gathering will enable us to defeat this virus faster , " he noted . <p> He said the DILG and the LGUs will strictly enforce the home quarantine measures for those suspected of having contracted the virus . <p> DILG Undersecretary and spokesman Jonathan Malaya said the decision to suspend classes and mass gatherings this week was recommended by the DOH Expert Advisory Group to the President as a pre-emptive social distancing measure to lower the number of people exposed to the virus , lower risk of transmission per contact , and to lower the average viral load . <p> He explained that under Code Red Alert Sublevel 1 , there is no need for a lock-down . <p> " We are still at Sublevel 1 and this type of alert level does not require a lockdown but only enhanced hygiene and pre-emptive social distancing measures , " Malaya said . <p> He added that these measures are applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet about other places in the country .

If some in the industry have their way , fashion as we knew it back when -- a two-season focus with creativity at the fore -- may be making a comeback , a back-to-the-future transition triggered by the coronavirus crisis . <p> Today , the Council of Fashion of Designers of America and the British Fashion Council will deliver to their memberships a joint message of purpose in response to the havoc wrought on the global fashion industry by the COVID-19 crisis . The missive 's recommendations are based on member input . <p> " The COVID-19 pandemic is hitting the fashion industry from every angle , " the statement reads . It offers that , " while there is no immediate end in sight , there is an opportunity to rethink and reset the way in which we all work and show our collections . " <p> The reset was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The statement maintains that , " The fashion system must change , and it must happen at every level .......

With existing inventory stacking up , designers and retailers must also look at the collections cycle and be very strategic about their products and how and when they intend to sell them . " <h> Related Gallery <p> The joint missive stems from the close , long-term relationships of CFDA chairman Tom Ford and chief executive officer Steven Kolb with BFC 's ceo Caroline Rush . The overarching message reflects a theme now coursing through fashion in general -- the need to slow down and reset , inclusive of what is becoming an industrywide battle cry to shrink production , focus on quality over quantity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stores and when the customer needs them . " <p> Specific attention is also given to a reemphasis on creativity , the heart of which is a return to a schedule with a major focus on two collections each year . " We understand the commercial need for pre-collections and the need to fulfill the delivery windows of the current pre-collections , " the statement reads . " However , we recommend that these return to their original intended purpose , which was to offer the consumer beautiful clothes that carry the ethos of the individual brands , but are not necessarily sufficiently fashion-forward to warrant a show . When we are able to hold in-person events and showings , we would recommend that these presentations return to the showrooms . " <p> While acknowledging that the spring 2021 showing season will be a virtual one , the statement looks ahead to a time , post-crisis , when in-person events can resume .

@@85033741 <h> Nevada governor amends church restrictions after DOJ criticism <p> Nevada Gov .

@@71851141 <h> SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY <p> Thanks for signing up ! <p> Please , for the love of god , do not tear down mobile phone towers . They are not making you sick . At a time when the world needs to unite to defeat the coronavirus , a few people seem hell-bent on doing otherwise . <p> Conspiracy theorists have been ranting about 5G for a long time now . Amid the coronavirus pandemic , they 've done the mental gymnastics to somehow link the two in order to keep their misinformation topical . The result is quite dangerous . <p> Their theory rests on two pillars : that the coronavirus epicenters are places with 5G networks , and that 5G radio waves are at a higher frequency than previous phone networks . It 's not clear how these prove any link between the two things , other than somehow , mysteriously , 5G is responsible for the virus . <p> While many who perpetuate the myth think they 're exposing a huge coverup , they 're actually just causing unnecessary panic . Tim Minchin put it best : " You 're not a maverick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <h> What exactly is 5G ? <p> 5G is the latest generation of mobile network technology , just like how 4G came after 3G . The benefits are faster speeds thanks to shorter wavelengths than previous technology . Most new smartphones are 5G capable . <p> While the waves are at a higher frequency than previous networks , they 're still non-ionising which means they do n't damage DNA like X-rays , gamma rays and UV rays do . There is also no evidence for any other supposed health effects such as immune suppression , either . <p> The shorter wavelength means the signals have a shorter range , and they also have trouble travelling through buildings . In cities , this means far more mobile phone towers need to be built in order for 5G coverage to supersede 4G coverage . <h> How does 5G relate to the coronavirus pandemic ? <p> It does n't , but some people argue otherwise . <p> One claim in particular is being used by 5G truthers to hook new converts to the conspiracy theory . They claim Wuhan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ' 5G smart city ' . <p> This phrase alone should be enough to dismiss the theory . It 's a claim impossible to prove or deny because it 's just to damn vague . ' Smart city ' is an advertising buzzword with no real meaning . While Wuhan was among a handful of cities to trial the technology last year , it has since become commonplace , including in Australia . <p> Proponents of the theory also point to bogus research on the supposed effects of 5G networks . This research is incoherent and not peer-reviewed . It links a bunch of desperate claims , themselves unreliable , with no real evidence . Because the 5G movement has been around since long before the coronavirus pandemic , conspiracy theorists have a huge stash of made-up research to draw from . <p> Some people are spreading maps overlaying 5G towers with large virus clusters . What they fail to realise is that you could overlay any almost any datasets on a map and they would still highlight large cities . The coronavirus spreads quickly in dense urban areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5G technology , thanks to their large population . You could overlay pigeons with post offices and notice a similar correlation . <h> Who is behind the conspiracy ? <p> In a lecture uploaded to YouTube , a so-called Dr ThomasCowan , who has no clear medical qualifications , claims there were so few confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa because of a lack of 5G infrastructure on the continent . This is of course a correlation without any proven causation , and willfully ignores many factors including including the way people move around the world and they way virus outbreaks are reported in different countries . <p> Cowan , for his part , is a rabid anti-vaxxer and has strong opinions about bogus cancer treatments too . It 's unclear whether he actually studied medicine or , if like Doc Antle from Tiger King , he 's just bestowed the title upon himself . His main claim to fame is being a former president of the Physicians ' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine , a fringe organisation promoting alternative medicine that has absolutely no standing in the scientific community . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media . Some versions of the theory claim there is no such things as the coronavirus , and we 're all sick from 5G radiation instead . Others claim governments around the world are using 5G networks to inflict the coronavirus upon their citizens . <p> Even celebs have begun spreading the dangerous misinformation at a time when a wrong decisions could cost lives . M.I.A. tweeted , " Last pandemic came with radio waves . Now 5G . " Meanwhlie , Zombieland actor Woody Harrelson also posted a video on Instagram perpetuating the conspiracy theory . In Australia , Anthony Mundinetold his Facebook fans 5G was deployed to cause the coronavirus and establish a " new world order " . <p> Most social networks have pledged to remove content blaming the coronavirus pandemic on 5G networks , however these posts remain online . <h> Is it just a harmless myth ? <p> No ! <p> Anything kind of misinformation during global pandemic can have serious consequences . At a time when people need to come together , getting distracted by bullshit myths is a huge distraction , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , multiple mobile phone towers have been destroyed by mobs as people blame them for the pandemic . We 're currently more reliant on mobile networks than ever , and thanks to social distancing , maintenance is harder than usual . Tearing these towers down creates the perfect storm . <p> " Not only are these claims baseless , they are harmful for the people and businesses that rely on the continuity of our services , " said a joint statement from the UK 's four largest mobile network operators : EE , o2 , Three , and Vodafone . <p> " They have also led to the abuse of our engineers and , in some cases , prevented essential network maintenance taking place .

" For one to spew such hate , what would happen if there was a fire in Lakewood ? His job is to protect the citizens of Lakewood . We are the largest town in Ocean County .

" <p> Schnall said he is not surprised by the surge in anti-Semitism . Historically , in times of crisis or social upheaval , the Jewish people have always been used as scapegoats , he said . <p> " Anti-Semitism has always been around , it exists , we all know it exists , " Schnall said . " Every synagogue and every school ( in Lakewood ) is closed . ... I have n't been to my synagogue in two weeks . " <p> Even the largest kosher grocery store in Lakewood limits the number of customers who may enter the store and the number of members from each family , he added . <p> The irony , Schnall asserted , is that Lakewood is doing more to enforce social distancing and in minimizing the spread of the virus than what the government requires . <p> " It is hurtful and it is shameful , " he said of the remarks posted on Pasola 's account .

@@84642141 <p> Kelly 's executive order was intended to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus throughout the state .

We are attaching a copy of the official request that was signed and posted to the Connacht secretary . <p> " We would like to ask all club delegates to think about the following : <p> " Why have clubs not been officially informed by the Connacht Secretary since 10th March that the 10 members who stepped away requested an EGM ? <p> " Why has no official from Connacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is the EGM requested on March 10th going to be facilitated . If not , why not ? <p> " We stepped away until answers are given to the questions that you the delegates and we the executive have been asking since December . <p> " Why has the chairperson refused to answer any queries regarding the Garda report she made alleging misappropriation of Mayo LGFA funds in December ? <p> " Why are answers not forthcoming on the ? 19,300 written down to senior management in 2019 ? <p> " Why is there such a rush to replace the executives that stepped away ? <p> " Clubs now need to decide which EGM goes ahead : <p> 1 . The one requested by the 10 executive members on March 10th where we get clarity on outstanding issues and move forward and enforce procedures , transparency and accountability ; or <p> 2 . The EGM requested by the Connacht secretary to elect a new executive . In this scenario , all questions regarding finance and accountability go unanswered . <p> " Is this the standard we want and expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance , transparency and accountability that is acceptable to Connacht and Croke Park ? <p> " With the support of the delegates , we are willing to resume our respective roles once our questions have answered and we can ensure there is transparency and accountability in all Mayo LGFA matters . " <p> The Connacht Ladies GAA secretary , as already stated , sent two emails to the Mayo clubs last week . <p> The first of these outlined that Mayo Ladies GAA will hold an EGM when restrictions on gatherings due to Covid-19 are lifted . <p> It reads : " Can I start by hoping that you , your family and your club are coping with the extraordinary times we are living in . <p> " None of us know when the Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted , but they will some time . <p> " The first thing that will happen , when the restriction on gatherings is lifted , Mayo LGFA will have an EGM . <p> " The EGM will elect personnel to fill the vacant positions on the executive of the board .

The covered bond market is an important driver of the economic recovery , whether that be through retained issuance for emergency liquidity backstop lines or real term funding . <p> The French banks opened the market in Europe in March , which was exactly what happened after Lehman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face today is very different from 2008 ; it 's not a financial crisis but a real economy crisis . <p> A lot of work has been done by various European financial institutions which are now better capitalised due to banking union and regulatory reform -- so they 're starting from a much stronger position . <p> Today the banking sector represents part of the solution able to support the real economy towards the recovery . The ECB and other central banks have provided a large and reliable funding line , which means there is likely to be less dependency on market based funding -- even though it is open and there ready to use . <p> Can you tell me about the EMF-ECBC 's Covid-19 task force ? <p> No one really knows how the crisis will change the market so we decided to take a kind of scientific approach in the covered bond space by creating a task force to monitor the global mortgage market developments , gather statistics and bring together various government measures into one place . <p> The task force is composed of retail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will meet virtually at least once a week for as long as is necessary . The task force will identify market best practices and solutions with a view to delivering a coordinated recovery plan . <p> What sort of information does the monitoring report contain ? <p> The monitoring report gives an overall picture providing an outline and signposts to the major policy measures that have been instigated by institutions like the European Central Bank , European Banking Authority , the Bank for International Settlements and the European Commission . It also sets out the various measures allowing mortgage holidays , mortgage moratoria and state guarantees . <p> This is presented in the form of a grid to help improve informational exchange . It also provides a helpful guide for countries considering implementing new measures . There 's also an extensive annex which sets out official announcements from various government agencies , and a second annex covering mortgage housing statistics such as data on loan-to-value ratios , average time to foreclosure and current mortgage arrears . <p> In April we began work refreshing the label website to improve transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy efficient mortgage label which tags green loan assets , as well as green funding . We 've developed a new tool to capture key information on the asset side within the cover pool to present data in a standardised way using pie charts and histograms . We expect this to facilitate investor due diligence and enable comparative analysis of different issuers in different countries . In essence the new HTT tool provides an informational bridge to view heterogeneous cover pool data in a standardised comparable homogenous format . <p> Could the updated pool information be used to show payment holidays ? <p> It is very clear that the HTT could help to rapidly provide transparency to investors and we are planning to introduce a new tab which will supply information on loans that have been effected by national mortgage moratoriums and payment holidays . <p> We 're hoping to put this on a fast track and have everything agreed by the label committee meeting on June 4 . We are coordinating action to ensure that the high quality of cover pools is maintained , so covered bonds can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with various national authorities to see what action can feasibly be taken . <p> The EBA says loans more than 90 days overdue should not be counted as delinquent . Is there any view in the covered bond industry how this could be accounted for in the cover pool with respect to the asset collateral test ? <p> This will be part of our response . We are digesting what 's going on and speaking to the EBA to see what 's feasible and work out the best way forward . <p> Do you think the public sector covered bond market can be reinvigorated to respond to the current crisis with a new stream of stable funding for municipalities and local authorities ? <p> I think so . In 2003 the public sector represented 80% of the German Pfandbrief market as it was used to support an unprecedented effort to reunify Germany . Nowadays it 's other way around , with less than 20% of the market used for public sector funding . But what we see more and more is that the economic recovery can not be managed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the debate taking place around the German Federal Constitutional Court ruling that there is a need for a strong private sector able to support the recovery alleviating pressure on public debt . <p> We believe covered bonds can play an important role in the roadmap to the European Green Deal . As Caffil has already demonstrated with its Covid-19 covered bond , which secures funding for the French healthcare system , the public sector covered bond market is a financial instrument at the disposal of many financial institutions which has demonstrated a successful track record of funding economic recovery . <p> What is the potential role European Secured Notes ( ESN ) play in the recovery ? <p> The ESN had become a little impractical as the funding had not made much sense when spreads were tight . But now , with the widening of covered bonds to senior unsecured , the ESN funding option is back on the table . SMEs are a major driver of employment and growth in Europe , so bringing funding and liquidity to them is considered a bankable priority for the European Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to be developed with a green connection and have something like the Lettres de gages ? nergies renouvelable project .

For more than a decade , Nagar , an Indian citizen , had steadily built a life in the United States but she was now back in India , awaiting a visa extension . She and her husband , who works for Microsoft , have applied for green cards . They hung an American flag from their balcony in their home in Washington state , where Nagar had given birth to the couple 's 5-year-old daughter . But when Nagar read Trump 's tweet posted late Monday , while separated from her family in the United States , the thought of leaving her hard-forged life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I beg the government not to think of us as enemies , " Nagar , 39 , a software developer , said . " I want the US to prosper . It has given us so much . " By Tuesday , Trump had ordered a 60-day halt in issuing green cards to prevent people from immigrating to the United States , backing away from his harder-edged plans to suspend guest-worker programs after business groups erupted in anger at the prospect of losing labor from countries like India . But as millions of Americans file for unemployment , flooding food banks and hospitals , foreign workers worry that the pandemic will uproot them sooner rather than later . Immigrant groups warn that driven by what they call the Trump administration 's protectionist impulses , the United States could purge some of its most talented workers , cutting into the vibrant multiculturalism that has made the United States such an attractive destination for decades . " I can not tell you the panic this has caused in the legal immigration community , " Nandini Nair , an immigration lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upending of life by a tweet .

Indian-Americans are some of the country 's most successful and wealthiest immigrants , with a particular stronghold in Silicon Valley 's startup scene . These days , Harkamal Singh Khural , 34 , a software developer living in an Atlanta suburb , said he was barely sleeping . Even if the government did not push him out , he said a volatile job market meant his immigration status was already tenuous .

But Tuesday , Trump left open the possibility of extending the ban on new green cards " based on economic conditions at the time . " He suggested that he may also introduce a second executive order that could further restrict immigration , brushing aside studies showing that a flow of foreign labor into the country has an overall positive effect on the US workforce and wages . " We must first take care of the American worker , " Trump said , insisting that newly jobless citizens should not have to compete with foreigners when the economy reopens . Rights groups say the immigration process has become increasingly complex and frustrating in recent years , with Trump fanning the flames of anti-immigrant sentiment by pushing for an extensive wall along the Mexican border and labeling a group of African nations " shithole countries .

But it stalled in the Senate , where critics like Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , argued that the bill would not solve the problem because it does not increase the overall number of green cards . Many Indian citizens said the back-and-forth was exhausting . " I likely wo n't receive a green card in this lifetime unless the laws change , " said Somak Goswami , an electrical engineer who applied for a green card in 2011 .

@@41973241 <p> After seven weeks of lockdown and more than 30,000 deaths , the first phase of the UK 's coronavirus outbreak is slowly drawing to a close . On Sunday April 10 , prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a slight relaxing of distancing rules that should see exercise limits relaxed , but is likely to be a long way off the kind of national unshackling splashed across tabloid front pages on April 7 . <p> Easing the UK 's lockdown will depend on us managing to prevent another spike in coronavirus cases like the one which pushed the NHS to its very limits in late March . The government is hoping that the NHS contact tracing app , currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight , will allow it to stay on top of new Covid-19 cases and stop them before they spiral into localised outbreaks . <h> Advertisement <p> The contact tracing app -- already dogged by concerns over privacy and its effectiveness -- is only the technological heart of the UK 's contact tracing plan . The government is also hiring 18,000 contact tracers to do the leg work of identifying people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease to and following up with those contacts to ensure they do n't continue the chain of transmission . <p> But there are signs that the UK 's contact tracing plans are already on shaky foundations . After largely dropping contact testing on March 12 , the UK 's scheme will be taking off from a standing start . Wide-scale testing , which forms the central part of any contact tracing scheme , is already faltering as the government has hit its self-imposed 100,000-a-day testing target just twice since it was announced . And scientists are dubious that , with local authority health departments eviscerated by years of cuts , contact tracing teams will have the detailed local knowledge required to carry out effective contact tracing . <h> Read next <h> This startup helps self-isolating surgeons work from home <p> ByJo ? o Medeiros <p> Lessons from other countries that have implemented effective contact tracing regimes show the scale of the challenge now facing the UK . In Singapore , which is currently seeing a spike in cases after keeping them low for many weeks , all suspected coronavirus cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases were placed under mandatory quarantine for 14 days . Although the country was one of the first to release an automated contact tracing app , it has relied on a network of police officers and army staff to trace thousands of contacts each day . <p> " If you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact tracing system deployed or under development , anywhere in the world , is ready to replace manual contact tracing , I will say without qualification that the answer is , No , " wrote Jason Bay , the product lead for TraceTogether , Singapore 's contact-tracing app , in a blog post . <h> Advertisement <p> Simply tracing contacts is n't enough . In South Korea , moderately sick Covid-19 patients are sent to isolation dorms at converted workplaces , while asymptotic contacts of recent cases must follow strict self-quarantine at home and use separate bathrooms and cooking equipment from cohabitants . Dedicated contact tracers follow-up with contacts twice daily to see if they have developed symptoms . In China , mild cases were also sent to isolation wards to recover . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-home isolation , but this could be helpful for particularly vulnerable people says Gabriel Scally , a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director for public health . People who share crowded homes could be putting their household at risk if they isolate at home , he says . " There would be a good case in my view for helping the person spend their period of isolation somewhere they would n't have such direct contact with others . " <p> Doing so would require local expertise and spare accommodation capacity . " There is a need for local knowledge , particularly around the close contact issue , " Scally says . Local contact tracers would be more familiar with likely contact hot-spots in communities and also better set-up to contact people who are more vulnerable or likely to be completely isolated . <h> Read next <h> How to make a face mask using what you already have at home <p> BySabrina Weiss <p> This is n't the approach that the UK is taking . Of the 18,00 contact tracers being recruited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doctors and nurses recruited from the pool of volunteer retired NHS employees and the remaining 15,000 will staff call centres reportedly outsourced to private operators . According to a letter sent by Public Health England to directors of public health , local council resources will go towards managing the most complex outbreaks , such as those in care homes . <h> Advertisement <p> It is no surprise that local authorities are n't being asked to deliver the bulk of contact tracing . Even if they wanted to , a decade of cuts to council budgets mean that local public health departments simply do n't have the staffing to run widespread contact tracing , Jim McManus , director of public health for Hertfordshire County Council says that he is operating with a third less staff than he had in 2005 . " We have expertise and experience ; we do n't have capacity in and of ourselves to deliver this national system . " <p> Even done effectively , contact tracing is no silver bullet against this pandemic . A study from Shenzhen in China found that contact tracing reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 4.6 days after the first sign of infection down to 2.7 days . But this still leaves a window where people are possibly spreading the infection without knowing it . As an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine notes , transmission from people who are n't showing symptoms yet ( or never show symptoms ) is one of the major challenges we 're facing in combating the disease . Narrowing the window of asymptomatic transmission will mean tracking contacts extremely closely and making sure they have rapid access to tests . <p> And contact tracing itself is only one part of the puzzle . The government is reportedly already preparing to cut wage subsidies while an additional 600,000 young people are facing unemployment in the next year . Without a financial safety net , people in precarious employment may be unable to comply with strict self-isolation requirements . <p> By the time the government 's mid-May hiring deadline comes around , it will have been two months since the UK last widely pursued contact tracing . The country will be well past its initial peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a more drawn-out , intractable nature .

@@84873441 <p> State Sen. Teresa Ruiz ( D-Essex ) is sponsoring a bill that would overhaul the state 's main welfare program , Work First New Jersey . <p> Several measures that are meant to address individuals ' financial needs due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were advanced by a New Jersey Assembly committee Thursday . But with some of the bills calling for a state appropriation , their future is unclear . <p> Last Monday , Gov . Phil Murphy vetoed five of eight bills that sought to spend state money to help needy individuals , students and food banks and in all cases cited the state 's " dire " financial situation as the reason for his absolute vetoes . Murphy has repeatedly declined to provide specifics about the state 's budget situation but wants to borrow money to shore up finances . <p> Such sentiment may not bode well for at least two of the measures seeking to provide a combined $125 million in emergency relief to individuals that the Assembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee approved Thursday in the first ever videoconference of a state legislative committee . The meeting was noteworthy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak that Republicans vocalized their objections to measures the Democratic-controlled Legislature has been advancing to provide assistance to New Jerseyans . <h> Emergency rental assistance <p> The more expensive of those bills ( A-3956/S-2332 ) would create a $100 million emergency rental assistance program for those who have lost income due to the viral outbreak and closure of most businesses in the state . The bill 's sponsors are hoping that a provision requiring the state to use federal emergency assistance funding before a general state appropriation will make the measure more palatable to Murphy . <p> Tenants with incomes of up to 120% of an area 's median income -- which for affordable housing purposes ranges as high as $82,810 for an individual in Hunterdon , Middlesex and Somerset counties -- and who are at least 30 days past due on paying rent would be eligible . The bill would take effect immediately and expire 90 days after the end of the eviction moratorium Murphy put in place as part of emergency measures during the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> David Brogan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would use the framework of the existing state Homelessness Prevention Program to provide rental payments " there 'll be a seamless transition into administering this program because DCA ( the Department of Community Affairs ) has been administering the HPP for many , many years and there is no need to establish a new governmental organization to implement the program . " <h> Looking to revise welfare program <p> The other bill with a price tag ( A-3905 ) would spend $17 million -- reduced from $25 million in the original bill -- in revising the state 's main welfare program , Work First New Jersey ( WFNJ ) , although that money would come from general state revenues . Last Monday , Murphy vetoed A-3858 , which had sought to issue supplemental cash payments to WFNJ recipients , despite saying he shared the sponsors ' " concerns for the well-being of those in need " because of its likely high , though unspecified , cost . <p> Most importantly , and expensively , it would increase Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) benefits to provide a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently , a family of three gets $559 a month , which is just 31% of poverty . Additionally , the bill would expand eligibility to include college students and immigrants not currently able to collect , update acceptable work requirements to include classes , training and internships , expand reasons why recipients can be excused from meeting requirements due to health or safety considerations . It would also prevent the current public health emergency from counting toward the time limit recipients have to comply with work requirements . <p> Raymond Castro , director of health policy at the progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective , said the bill embodies a number of reforms recommended by a recent report that " identified many disturbing policies that destabilize families , discourage work and perpetuate , rather than alleviate , poverty . " <p> Such arguments did n't sway Assemblyman Robert Auth ( R-Bergen ) , who cast one of two " no " votes . <p> " I have so many constituents that are in jeopardy of losing their homes during this right now and their concerns have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody bear a little bit of the burden . " <h> Long-term economic benefits ? <p> But Senator Teresa Ruiz ( D-Essex ) , a sponsor of the Senate version of the bill , said overhauling the program would help people get jobs and get out of poverty , which would ultimately improve the state as a whole . <p> " Our public assistance programs must be focused on lifting individuals out of poverty , placing them on a path towards self-sustainability and ensuring a smooth transition as they shift towards independence , " she said . " The changes approved today will do just that , making the Work First New Jersey program more accessible and allowing it to better serve our state 's most vulnerable by placing a greater focus on improving long term financial stability . " <p> The bill has already cleared the state Senate and could get final approval from the Assembly as early as next week . <p> A third bill passed by the committee ( A-3908 ) is meant to provide New Jerseyans with some measure of protection from creditors and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medical creditors and debt collectors to take certain legal actions -- seizing a bank account or garnishing wages , for instance -- against an individual for 180 days after the first medical bill has been sent . The measure would also prevent a consumer report or credit-scoring model from considering an individual 's adverse financial situation due to the COVID-19 emergency as a negative factor in determining whether to grant credit if the person has alerted a consumer reporting agency of loss of income . <p> " With the most recent labor report revealing that about one in 10 New Jerseyans is filing for unemployment , it is abundantly clear residents are struggling , " said Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson ( D-Mercer ) , a bill sponsor . " Making ends meet right now is a daily fight and often a decision between putting food on the table and paying bills . Ensuring there are no long-term consequences for an inability to meet certain financial obligations , so people can focus on providing for themselves and their families first , is what we must do . " <p> But an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped important provisions -- such as protecting individuals from all debt collection procedures , rather than just medical debt collections -- out of the measure when it amended the bill . Beverly Brown Ruggia urged the full Assembly to restore the protections . <p> " Last minute amendments that favor debt collectors and corporate interests have stripped this bill of many vital financial protections consumers desperately need during this pandemic , " Ruggia said . " Instead of ensuring relief and stability , the legislation as it stands will leave millions of New Jerseyans right where they have been for two months : vulnerable , financially insecure and scared .

@@41880041 <p> On March 17th 2020 , the Malaysian ( Federal ) Religious Department announced the closure of all mosques in response to the Covid-19 pandemic . Five days later it announced the creation of a special task force to handle the remains of the victims . Both edicts affect only Federal territories . There is still no effective federal/state coordination . <p> It is humbling that an ultra-tiny packet of RNA could wreck such havoc on human civilization . <p> Beyond the social upheavals and economic devastations , this Covid-19 virus also inflicts consequential but underappreciated impact on the individual psyche , both the healthy as well as the infected . Despite advances in neuro- and behavioral sciences , there is still a huge void in understanding this facet of the pandemic . <p> This is where we need our spiritual and religious leaders . Just as there are no atheists in a foxhole , likewise there are no non-believers in a pandemic . We need and depend on a higher power to reassure us , and each other to protect and sustain us . <p> In this regard , I am heartened that my Imam Ilyas had recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prayers at home , he advised . <p> Singapore 's Mufti too did likewise . Religion is about priorities , he emphasized . The top priority now is not to endanger ourselves and others . He went further . His organization has put out an informative public service video demonstrating how the virus could spread through hugging , handshaking , and prostrating , all activities associated with congregational prayers . <p> A church in America provides telehealth mental health services . It encourages its followers to maintain regular communications with their loved ones via phones , Facetime , and other platforms . It offers tips on keeping the conversations hopeful so as not to burden others with your anxieties . Other suggestions include reading together passages from the Holy Book , reviewing family pictures , and sharing stories . <p> Many religious leaders neglect this crucial role of guidance . Malaysian ulama , all on state payroll , instead engage in sterile sermons . We should fear Allah more than Covid-19 , they bellowed , and that the virus is Allah 's punishment ! <p> Words , more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those pronouncements resulted in Malaysia 's second and much more devastating surge in new cases . <p> Imagine the lives saved , costs not incurred , and families spared needless grief had that Sri Petaling Tabligh religious gathering been cancelled . Nor has that crucial lesson been learned . There was a much bigger festival later in Indonesia , a nation ill equipped to handle the inevitable spike in new infections . <p> Those ulama have yet to own up to their accountability for these preventable tragedies . <p> Religious leaders have minimal knowledge on medical and public health issues ; they should not pretend otherwise . Instead they should endorse those public health measures , using their religious knowledge to buttress the arguments . Likewise , Malaysian professionals should not abrogate their responsibilities by giving those bureaucrat-ulama veto powers . <p> Be guided by our prophetic traditions . If you hear of an outbreak in a land , do not enter it . If you are in it , then do not leave the area , goes one . Cleanliness is part of faith , is another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general cleansing of the hands , face , and feet . <p> Yet Malaysians , instigated by their ulama , are obsessed with public ostentatious displays of their faith , with endless emotional du'as and mass sembayang tahajut . They should be reminded of another prophetic wisdom . First tie your camel securely , only then pray that it does not escape ! In the current context , first observe social distancing and wash your hands often , only then pray and make du'a . <p> On another front , imagine the anguish of bereaved families when they could not administer the traditional funeral rites , as with washing the bodies . Or worse , when they breach hygienic principles , thus endangering themselves and others . <p> Indonesia 's Imam Das'ad Latif advice is instructive . He likened the pandemic to war , with the victims syahid ( martyrs ) , destined for Allah 's special slot in Heaven . Thus the usual rites as with ablution and prayers could be dispensed with , as during the prophet 's time with those who died in battles . Such soothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . <p> Stress , more so chronic ones , is deleterious to our immune system , and thus our resistance to viruses and diseases . This is aggravated by associated loneliness , psychiatric symptoms , and life events . Prayers , meditation , and mindfulness alleviate stress . <p> Modern neuroscience 's greatest achievement is to integrate these observations at the molecular level , of how stress hormones affect neurotransmitters or alter the conformations of our genes and thus their expression . Of greater significance is that those consequences are transmitted to the next generation and beyond , as indicated by studies on victims of mass starvation in China during Mao , and in the Netherlands during the WWII Nazi blockade . <p> In short , what my Imam Ilyas , Singapore 's Mufti Nazirudin , and Indonesia 's Imam Das'ad Latif are doing is harness their spiritual leadership to calm and guide their followers . By contrast , those fiery , science-challenged Youtube preachers put the fear of Allah in their listeners , aggravating their stress , the very antithesis of the purpose of faith . <p> Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less an Imam , more an executive .

We can not risk turning Houses of Allah into Houses of Pestilence . <p> Religion is to guide and protect , not lead us into danger . Islam is a set of universal principles to guide us to and keep us on the straight path . It is not a compilation of rigid rituals to be mindlessly performed .

They were expecting for the lockdown to be lifted on April 14 . <p> However , shortly after the extension of the lockdown to May 3 , Rao , alongwith 150 other labourers set off on foot to their villages in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh , 700 kilometres away . They were lucky to get an empty truck . However , as they approached Uppal highway , the police flagged them down and after a two-hour negotiation , sent them back to their single-room rented accommodations in East Marredpally . <p> Over 2,000 migrants from Srikakulam district work as daily wage labourers in the booming construction industry of Hyderabad . Some are masons , while others do tile laying , plastering , painting , and electrical wiring .

Now they are compelled to borrow at high interest and support us ! " said Chiranjeevi , a young man in his twenties , who works as a mason and earns Rs 800-900 per day . Chiranjeevi , Rao 's cousin , has studied up to intermediate and has been in Secunderabad for the last five years , going home only for special occasions . " It is better for us to go back to the village . We also have to help in farm work back home now , " he added . His wedding , which was to be held on April 25 , has now been postponed too . <p> Rao meanwhile , worked as a mason , and together with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 rupees in a good month .

His wife and he were eager to return to their two children who are in Santabommali village in Srikakulam with their elderly parents . <p> Unlike the thekedars or builders whom the government asked to support the labourers affiliated to them with cash and/or ration , the skilled Srikakulam labourers were practically left holding their implements as their livelihood meant being picked up work from the labour adda , where each day 's work is with a different contractor . <p> Most labourers come to work in Hyderabad and Secunderabad as seasonal migrants for eight months in a year , and they return with Rs 1.5 lakh earnings on average , said Avala Khagesh , president of the year-old Greater Hyderabad Outside Gova Union . Gova means scaffolding in the local language . <p> Khagesh said that roughly three lakh labourers from Andhra Pradesh are working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union 's 12 branches across the city .

" <p> The current situation , and little assistance <p> " Each small tenement of a 10-squarefoot room with a makeshift kitchen is shared by six to seven labourers -- either families or single men , " Khagesh said . " After the COVID-19 outbreak , the owners began limiting occupancy to just two persons per room , triggering panic departures . And those left behind are desperate without any earnings , with rents to pay , and new conditions from landlords . They had no help from anywhere . " <p> Khagesh had contacted G Sayanna , Member of Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) from Secunderabad Cantonment , sharing their concerns about lack of work , new problems of accommodation , no wages or rations for them to survive . The MLA asked them to contact the Mandal Revenue Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On March 31 , the Telangana government announced through an order that migrant labourers are entitled to 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash . However , the promised ration did not reach them till April 14 and the looming extension of the lockdown until May 3 left them with no option but to head back home . <p> Sunil Nathani , Marredpally Mandal Revenue Officer ( MRO ) , explained the technical issues in supporting the labourers from Srikakulam with ration . " As per the government order ( GO 13 ) , all labourers from outside the state of Telangana are eligible for 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash , however , the case of the Srikakulam labourers was different . " <p> " Most of the labourers have spent over seven to 10 years here , earn well and do not fall in the strict definition of ' migrant worker ' . In a rapid survey conducted in Marredpally 's eight different ' labour addas ' during the first phase of lockdown , i.e. , until 14 April , the Revenue Department identified 645 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Srikakulam labourers were found eligible for this relief , " he revealed . The Tehsil office distributed 12 kg rice and Rs 500 to all those labourers . <p> " However , as the matter of Srikakulam labourers ( the instance of their staging a walk back to their village ) came to light , a more in-depth survey was conducted in the second phase which helped them identify 950 labourers in the Tehsil , which included 450 labourers from Srikakulam , " Sunil added . <p> He sounded surprised at the Union 's claim of the presence of 2,000 labourers . " If the Tehsil office has still left out migrants eligible for support , we are willing to consider them favourably , " he said , when asked if the second survey could have further missed several labourers . <p> Lack of administrative coordination <p> One of the biggest challenges with migrant workers is getting the exact number , said Dr Usha Seethalakshmi , an independent researcher and member Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch ( MAKAAM ) , a national forum that works with women farmers and workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labour department website records 15,45,845 labourers in the state , including 6,23,714 women . However , as per GO 13 , the state came up with the figure of 3,35,669 labourers . <p> " This is a gross underestimate of migrant workers given the phenomenal growth of real estate , irrigation infrastructure in the state , especially in the last six years , " observed Seethalakshmi . " Most obviously the allocation of 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash will be inadequate , " she added . <p> Acknowledging the difficulty of recording data of migrant labourers in a city like Hyderabad , especially the 650 square kilometres of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) area , Ravinder Reddy , the Deputy Commissioner of Labour for Hyderabad-1 said that the discrepancies arise from lack of coordination amongst departments . <p> During COVID-19 response , GHMC , Revenue Department and Labour Department , all came out with their own separate lists of migrant workers . The Revenue Department 's first list of migrant workers in Hyderabad city alone showed a figure of 34,000 workers ; a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final consolidated list of all surveys by all departments established 84,000 workers . As per the government order , 12 kg of rice each and Rs 500 were distributed to some 60,000 workers . For the rest , the distribution is still ongoing , informed Reddy . This , on April 22 , almost a month after the lockdown began on 24 March . <p> Contractors not following norms hurts workers <p> The real estate boom in Hyderabad , actively promoted by the state government , has attracted large numbers of skilled and unskilled interstate , and in much larger numbers intrastate , migrant workers . <p> Every contractor is expected to register under the Building and Other Construction Workers ' Act , 1966 ( BCOW ) , explained Seethalakshmi . The Central Act , binding on builders and contractors , was enacted with the objective of ensuring the safety , security and regulating the working conditions of the workers . But most builders and contractors evade registration of workers and payment of cess -- one percent of the cost of construction -- towards workers ' welfare fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in as part of a larger policy framework of ' ease of doing business ' -- and the inspections by the labour department made non-mandatory for an enabling environment , has allowed builders and contractors to get away with several violations , " explained Seethalakshmi . <p> According to COVID-19 Advocacy Lockdown Collective , a collective of social activists , the Telangana government has collected Rs 1,201 crore as cess towards workers ' welfare fund and as of December 31 , 2018 , and has spent only Rs 263 crore . In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister dated 12 April , the Collective urged the government to extend a one-time financial assistance of Rs 2500 , in addition to the 12 kg rice and Rs 500 to workers , using this fund . To minimise the distress , it appealed for immediate payment of all pending claims of workers from the welfare fund , along with the wages due to them , to arrange for their safe transit , accommodation with adequate sanitation , and cr ? che facilities for children . <p> As the government struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to hit the road . Some are turned back , but many managed , almost , to reach their homes . <p> The yearning to go home <p> " We were not the first batch of labourers to start our journey back home , " said Mukunda Rao . Out of the 2,000 labourers in the East Marredpally area , 200 had already left for home in the previous week in smaller batches , said Rao . <p> Rama Rao , Rani , and several others were relatively lucky to have jumped past Telangana border , but they have still not reached home to be with their families as they had desired . <p> 35-year-old Rama Rao along with his wife Rani and nine others had left their single-room tenement in East Marredpally at about 10 am on April 12 .

The police then collected the names and other details of everyone and sent them on a state transport bus to Srikakulam , to a degree college to be quarantined , where Rama Rao and Rani are presently lodged . <p> " The place is big , but there are too many people in every room .

@@41947141 <p> LONDON -- The route out of lockdown is less about finding a plan and more a search for a formula . <p> Like many governments around the world , the U.K. is considering how -- or even whether -- to lift restrictions , ahead of the next legally mandated review on May 7 . <p> Each government faces the same dilemma : how to balance the need to protect jobs and livelihoods suffocated by lockdown , with the need to prevent a resurgence of the virus that could cost thousands more lives . <p> The answers each country settles upon will likely be different -- and there is likely to be an element of trial and error . <p> Gabriel Leung , chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong , and one of Asia 's leading epidemiologists told POLITICO countries have " three main categories of interventions " at their disposal during this period -- or " dials " they can calibrate and adjust according to their own situation . <p> The " very clear red line " in this decision-making process is hospital capacity , according Gabriel Leung , chair of public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , border restrictions : not to keep coronavirus out necessarily ( that ship has sailed ) but to " maintain the integrity of the local health system . " Two , targeted quarantine and isolation of infected people , informed by testing and contact tracing . And three , " physical distancing . " <p> " Under each category you 've got a whole host of different things you may consider doing . Physical distancing can mean total lockdowns and curfews , or it can mean school closures or flexible work arrangements , or closing of bars and entertainment venues , but keeping restaurants open , or variations thereof , " Leung said , speaking earlier this month . <p> " Given those three dials , you need to find your combination that is contextually acceptable but also would be able to give you health protection , economic preservation and social acceptance . " <p> As measures start to lift , this third consideration -- social acceptance -- is likely to become more complicated if countries move at very different speeds . Governments will be challenged to explain why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European country , but not in another , or why some borders remain open while others are closed . <p> The " very clear red line " in this decision-making process is hospital capacity , " that you do not exceed your carrying capacity in your ICUs or your respirator availability , " Leung said . " But beyond that there are many , many other considerations . " <p> What 's more , this process could be one of " suppress and lift , " as Leung put it in a piece for the New York Times . " Cycles during which restrictions are applied and relaxed , applied again and relaxed again , in ways that can keep the pandemic under control but at an acceptable economic and social cost , " he wrote . <h> R we nearly there yet ? <p> In London , officials said , the decision-making process around how and whether to ease the lockdown will involve the government 's independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( SAGE ) drawing up a " suite of options , " based on different " combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reopening non-essential shops , or expanding people 's household " bubble " to include a few more people ) . Scientists will give ranged estimates of how each might impact on transmission of the virus -- and in turn the risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed . <p> Alongside , experts will model the likely impact of the U.K. 's revived " trace and isolate " strategy will have on transmission . <p> Key to calculations is the basic reproduction number , the R0 ( the average number of people one coronavirus-infected person passes the virus onto . ) The weight the U.K. is giving this was emphasized at Thursday 's daily government press conference where Johnson stated that " nothing we do " when trying to unlock the economy " should lift the R ... back above one . " <p> An R above 1 , England 's Chief Medical Officer and SAGE Vice Chair Chris Whitty made clear at Monday 's press conference , leads back to " exponential growth " of the outbreak . R is currently estimated to be between 0.5 and 1 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending how much above 1 it is , you would go back to a situation where the NHS is threatened to be overwhelmed , " he said . <p> While the scientists can model the effects of different measures on R , the decision about what R is acceptable -- and therefore which combination of measures , if any to choose -- is for politicians . <p> Another SAGE member , epidemiological modeling expert Neil Ferguson of Imperial College , told Unherd last week : " As a scientist I feel I can give some insight into what the consequences of certain decisions would be and indeed into potentially the sort of measures which would be needed to achieve a certain outcome . But really it is for decision-makers to make those decisions . " <h> Combination ( un ) lock <p> A U.K. official working on the coronavirus response agreed . <p> " That 's where the political element comes in . You can model everything but ultimately you have to make decisions along the way , " the official said . <p> Whitty says similar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures go together , that finally is one for ministers , " he said on Monday . <p> " There is no perfect solution where we 're going to end up being able to do all of the things people want and at the same time keep R below 1 ... there are going to have to be some very difficult choices , " he added . <p> No one knows how the British public will react if a restriction were lifted -- and then re-imposed , officials said . <p> Ferguson also emphasized that when thinking about hospital capacity , governments would have to consider not only whether the system can treat coronavirus patients , but also its ability to treat people with other health conditions and so avoid an increase in " indirect " deaths caused by the pandemic . <p> And even when ( if ) a decision is made to relax measures , it is possible -- to return to Leung 's " suppress and lift " concept -- that a particular measure -- for instance , reopening schools -- increases the R more than had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is something the U.K. government is particularly concerned about . While the level of public adherence to the initial lockdown measures has surprised some ministers who expected more resistance , no one knows how the public will react if a restriction were lifted -- and then re-imposed , officials said . There are fears that adherence would be lower , leading to higher spread .

While it is possible that the companies will choose to engage once the coronavirus crisis subsides , Xerox 's decision means that it will not get another chance to put such pressure on HP until its next annual shareholder meeting in spring 2021 . <p> The banks financing Xerox 's takeover bid " never wavered in their commitments " despite the market turmoil fueled by the coronavirus outbreak , the Norwalk , Connecticut-based company said . <p> " HP would like to thank our shareholders , partners , customers and employees for their input and continued support through this process , " HP said in a statement . <p> The market rout triggered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pause button on mergers and acquisitions , sabotaging the hopes of corporate advisers who expected a dealmaking bonanza this year . <p> Both Xerox and HP have seen their business suffer in the wake of the coronavirus crisis , though HP 's stock has proved more resilient , as employees working for home to protect themselves from the virus boosted revenue for its PCs and other office equipment . Xerox shares have lost more than half their value in the last five weeks , while HP shares are down about a quarter . <h> Printing in decline <p> The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment . This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse their revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost their market share . <p> HP , which separated from servers and networking equipment provider Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Inc in 2015 , has participated in this consolidation , acquiring Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 's printer business for $1.05 billion in 2017 . <p> Nevertheless , HP had been reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the latter launched its takeover campaign after reaching a settlement with Fujifilm Holdings Corp that resolved a legal dispute over their 57-year-old joint venture and a previous attempt to merge , yielding a $2.3 billion after-tax payoff for Xerox . <p> HP said that Xerox 's offer undervalued it and disputed the $2 billion value of potential cost synergies that Xerox put forward in a possible combination . It argued that its sale to Xerox would saddle the combined company with too much debt , and also raised questions on the impact on Xerox 's supply chain of losing Fujifilm as a partner . <p> HP engaged in deal talks with Xerox last year at the invitation of Icahn , a top Xerox shareholder who has since also acquired a stake in HP .

@@51688741 <p> GOVERNMENTS need to keep the non-monetary aspects of work in mind while supporting those rendered jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> Concern about COVID-19 has ravaged Canada 's labour market . Staggering unemployment numbers and the number of applicants for federal aid for laid-off workers dominate headlines . <p> The unprecedented effort to make up for lost wages has been admirable and sorely needed . But losing a job -- a reality millions of Canadians face -- involves far more than a loss of income . At a time of severe financial distress , it 's easy to forget that in the longer term , work is about more than money . <p> Many of the unemployment studies researchers reviewed for a Cardus report on the non-financial aspects of work examine populations experiencing forced mass layoffs , often in the form of plant closures . These situations closely resemble the current crisis . <p> Almost all of us , as employers , employees or those who 've lost jobs , are experiencing what research makes clear : losing a job is bad for your physical and mental health . <p> The list of negative physical health effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A recent review of the literature concludes , " Both short- and long-term declines in physical health , including worse self-reported health , physical disability , cardiovascular disease , greater number of reported medical conditions , increase in hospitalization , higher use of medical services , higher use of disability benefits , increase in self-destructive behaviours and suicide , and mortality . " <p> Those who are unemployed also have lower levels of psychological well-being , are more likely to struggle with depression and anxiety , and report lower life satisfaction and happiness compared to their employed counterparts . <p> The increased risk of physical and mental health problems facing the ballooning unemployed population is likely to compound the strain that hospitals already face . <p> In the most extreme cases , at least one study shows job loss can increase risk " of overall mortality and mortality caused by circulatory disease ; of suicide and suicide attempts ; and of death and hospitalization due to traffic accidents , alcohol-related disease , and mental illness .

The negative effects of a parent 's job loss on a child -- including greater risks of struggling at school , abuse , and neglect -- have been detected by researchers even decades later . <p> While family breakdown is traumatic enough in ordinary circumstances , being cooped up at home indefinitely can exacerbate the problem . Joblessness also frays our wider social fabric : someone who 's out of work is less likely to be involved in their community or volunteer than someone with a stable job . <p> Regardless of how we feel about our jobs , work ( or the lack of it ) is one of the most important aspects of our lives .

Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by , or intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the basis for prosecution under applicable US federal money laundering legislation . <p> While the approach to enforcement of such laws by the federal government in the United States has trended toward non-enforcement against individuals and businesses that comply with medical or adult-use cannabis programs in states where such programs are legal , strict compliance with state laws with respect to cannabis will neither absolve TerrAscend of liability under US federal law , nor will it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against TerrAscend . The enforcement of federal laws in the United States is a significant risk to the business of TerrAscend and any proceedings brought against TerrAscend thereunder may adversely affect TerrAscend 's operations and financial performance . <p> Forward Looking InformationThis news release contains " forward-looking information " within the meaning of applicable securities laws .

Below are some techniques for parties to protect themselves in the current crisis . <p> Impact on ongoing negotiations <p> Apart from the instinctive reaction to pause and reflect over the new developments , parties in the midst of negotiations will likely rethink some of the fundamental aspects of the deal , such as : <p> Valuation : Are the historical results of the target still a good benchmark for pricing and will the projections still hold the test of time ? Can the expected post-closing synergies still be achieved ? <p> Binding offer : How binding is an already signed binding offer and can one party discuss the terms or even walk away from the deal ? <p> Timeline : What is now the realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transaction structure : Buying or selling a stake rather than the whole company ? Investing in a different capital instrument ( e.g. convertible bonds ) ? Reducing exposure by acting in partnership , joint venture or consortia ? <p> Security : How to best secure indemnity and warranty claims against potentially insolvent sellers ? How to secure , on the other hand , sellers ' receivables for a retained part of the purchase price at a time when relying on purchasers ' continued liquidity or locking cash in escrow may not be an option ? <p> Impact on the due diligence process <p> Day-to-day business operations have been severely affected by travel bans , social distancing rules , quarantine measures , government-mandated closures and halted factory operations . As a result , on-site inspections and in-person management meetings will become more difficult or impossible . Extensive due diligence is even more important when facing the turbulence created by the COVID-19 pandemic , which has now become a due diligence focus of its own , underlying the more traditional topics . <p> Corporate : Is the target business organised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supervisory board , shareholders ' meeting ) to function properly despite restrictions related to COVID-19 or even illness of members ? Have recent crisis management decisions been taken in compliance with statutory procedures and director duties ? <p> Finance : Is there a risk of covenant breaches being triggered in financing agreements and how much exposure does this create for the target ( or any insolvency risk ) ? <p> Employment/Regulatory : Has the target complied with all COVID-19 related obligations as an employer ( i.e. information and transparency , alternative working methods such as home office and virtual meetings , additional health and safety measures , GDPR-compliant handling of medical data of employees who have or may have contracted the virus , redundancies only as permitted by law , etc . ) ? What are the legal and operational consequences if it has not ? <p> Material contracts : Is performance under contracts with customers and suppliers still possible in light of the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 ? Are certain customers or suppliers entitled to terminate their contract ? Could the target face damage claims as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Insurance : Would the existing insurance policies cover any losses that have already occurred or may occur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic ( e.g. losses due to mandatory closures , problems in the supply chain or inability to fulfil own contractual obligations ) ? <p> Others : Have sufficient measures been taken with regards to cybersecurity and trade secrets protection in light of home office / virtual meetings ? Has the target made use of or is it eligible to receive state emergency funding and if so under what conditions ? Does the target have appropriate crisis management policies and contingency plans ? <p> Impact on SPA terms <p> Purchase price : In split signing and closing , buyers are likely to push for a later valuation date , insisting on a closing accounts mechanism , so that interim negative impacts on the business can be captured in the price . Sellers will likely prefer the certainty of a historic pricing point and a locked-box mechanism . Hybrid mechanisms can also be used where the price is set by reference to locked-box accounts , but certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( via net debt adjustment ) and working capital . Adjustments could work either as a two-way euro-for-euro adjustment against an assumed/expected level , or an adjustment to only occur if the minimum assumed/expected level is not met . The closing accounts process provides protection as of closing ( and so only until then ) . As a post-closing protection in case the pandemic has longer term repercussions , buyers could seek deferred consideration provisions , retention of part of the purchase price or an earn-out . Sellers will resist a mechanism that links price to performance post-closing , as they will have limited or no control over the target business after closing . Such structures will be more common in the sale of a majority or minority stake , as the seller retains some influence over the business . Earn-outs may introduce significant pricing uncertainty because of complex adjustments , including to mitigate any adverse impact of choices made by the buyer in crisis times post-closing . <p> Conditions precedent / Long-stop date : Clearances ( e.g. merger control ) , consents or approvals from governmental authorities to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may delay the closing . Dealmakers should generally allow for extra time when setting deadlines for filings or formation of new SPVs , but also consider whether to add provisions for automatic extension of deadlines and/or the long-stop date where the delay is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or measures for its containment . <p> Pre-closing covenants : Pre-closing covenants are essentially about ensuring that the target companies continue their " ordinary course of business " until the time of their handover to the buyer . A question will arise as to what is ordinary in our current times , and how quickly the target company should react to imminent challenges . Obligations to refrain from taking certain actions without the buyer 's approval may conflict with the target 's need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and limit exposure . Sellers will need an exemption from these covenants to be able to take emergency measures to preserve the business . Buyers will seek an increased involvement in the pre-closing conduct of the business , with the risk of pushing the boundaries of competition law restrictions . Given restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for virtual access rights and other online solutions . <p> Warranties and disclosures : While there is no one-size-fits-all solution in M&amp;A deals , it is fairly common for buyers to insist on repetition of seller 's warranties at closing . If repetition will be a default or rather an exception , if there will be specific exclusions related to COVID-19 risks , what will be the value of pre-closing disclosures ? These will be strong negotiation points in forthcoming M&amp;A deals , in conjunction with all other limitations of seller 's warranties typically found in transactions of this type . Buyers may insist on specific representations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic . Sellers may seek a general COVID-19 related exclusion of liability . Ring-fencing ( i.e. if COVID-19 related claims can only be made under specific warranties and not under general warranties such as the accounts warranties ) , the buyer 's knowledge , changes in the law and other limitations will also be relevant . <p> With regards to warranty and indemnity insurance , the expectation is that the underwriting process will include detailed questions on the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis recovery policies and compliance with them . Where satisfactory answers to questions from the underwriters are not provided , or where certain impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are already known risks , there may be exclusions from the insurance coverage . It is possible to see a rise in the key man insurance policies . <p> MAC/MAE : Material Adverse Change ( " MAC " ) clauses have already been in the spotlight after the economic crisis , as many market players understood the significance of sudden changes in the economic circumstances of a deal . Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China , SPAs have cautiously shifted towards more specific MAC clauses , some of them pinpointing the pandemic as a MAC if coupled with a significant disruption of the business or an actual ( as opposed to anticipated future ) financial impact or linked to a specific risk ( like termination of essential contracts ) . While still a negotiation point , we will likely soon witness increased pressure from buyers to negotiate broader MAC clauses . On the other hand , once it becomes an established reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless coupled with extraordinary consequences or to the extent the target business is affected disproportionately to its industry . <p> Obviously , in an agreement signed today , a situation caused by COVID-19 may no longer qualify as a " change " but rather as an " effect " , which may prompt a shift towards Material Adverse Effect ( " MAE " ) clauses . Is the MAE measured on the target business as a whole or by reference to a specific financial metric ( e.g. EBITDA reduction ) or by reference to another KPI ? Is there enough time between signing and closing for the impact to materialise and be measured ? Would it suffice if an event or change has occurred which is " reasonably likely to have " an MAE rather than only where such an event or change has had such an effect before closing ? Are indirect impacts and effects captured if they can be attributed to COVID-19 ? The answers to these questions will be very deal specific . <p> Severability : This standard boilerplate clause could become critical if new legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal or unenforceable . <p> Can a party walk away now on account of the COVID-19 outbreak ? <p> There is no straightforward answer to this question .

People all over the United States and Europe and elsewhere are dying because of what we think was very , very poorly handled , which is probably the most diplomatic way of putting it , " he told AFP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key criticism is how the WHO , quoting Chinese scientists , initially said there was " no clear evidence " of human-to-human transmission of the mysterious virus found late last year in the metropolis of Wuhan . <p> Tedros in late January traveled to China to meet President Xi Jinping and praised Beijing 's " transparency " and cooperation with the WHO . <p> Smith said the WHO should have been " dogged " at a time that China was muzzling doctors including Li Wenliang , a Covid-19 whistleblower who later died of the disease . <p> " When they accepted the Chinese government 's line that there was no human-to-human transmission , there were people in Wuhan who were paying a terrible price for speaking truth to power , " Smith said . <p> " It 's either a competency issue or there 's some other agenda , and with the Chinese government there is always another agenda and the truth is always the first casualty , " he said . <p> Trump himself had said in January that the virus was " totally under control " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April due to warmer temperatures . <p> The United States has since recorded more than 14,700 deaths , with most of the population under some form of lockdown . <p> As criticism mounted of his own response , Trump heavily condemned Beijing over what he called the " Chinese virus . " <p> But his tone stepped up against the WHO after he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping and reached a truce with the Asian power , which supplies much of the medical equipment needed in the United States . <p> Trump -- whose tough line on immigration is a signature issue -- in particular has taken umbrage at the WHO 's initial criticism of his ban on visitors from China . <p> The WHO said as of late February that such bans were ineffective and warned of " negative social and economic effects , " but much of the world has now imposed major restrictions on travel . <h> Blame game <p> J. Stephen Morrison , director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the WHO deserved some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay in declaring a public health emergency . <p> But he said it was important to be realistic about the limited leverage of the WHO , especially when faced with a major power such as China . <p> " What is going on here , I believe , is that this is part of the Washington blame game , " Morrison said . <p> " This is the WHO getting caught in the middle of a worsening US-China confrontation and an increased effort by Washington to deflect attention away from Trump . " <p> Morrison said that Tedros had proven his competence , including the former Ethiopian foreign minister 's successful efforts to fight Ebola in Africa . <p> " It would have had no backing from the US or other powerful states if it had chosen to be confrontational with China at those key moments , " Morrison said of the WHO . <p> " It would have simply had its access terminated . " <h> Geneva response <p> For its part , in Geneva on Wednesday , as the WHO prepared to mark 100 days on Thursday since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tedros hit back at accusations that it had been too close to Beijing . <p> The UN 's health agency has faced criticism in the past both for overreacting and for moving too slowly in fighting epidemics , but it has rarely faced as much scrutiny as with the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> Tedros urged the United States to join with China in combating the disease rather than indulging in a blame game , as he issued a stern defense of the WHO 's management of the pandemic . <p> " The United States and China should come together and fight this dangerous enemy , " Tedros told a virtual press briefing in Geneva . <p> " The focus of all political parties should be to save their people . Please do n't politicize this virus . <p> " If you do n't want many more body bags , then you refrain from politicizing it , " the WHO chief argued , before adding later : " It 's like playing with fire . " <p> Citing the death toll and number of infections , Tedros implored : " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Personal abuse <p> The WHO was deemed too alarmist when it faced the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 but five years later it was accused of dragging its feet in declaring an emergency over the Ebola outbreak in west Africa , which killed more than 11,000 people . <p> On Wednesday , in a highly unusual turn , Ethiopia 's former health and foreign minister spoke out for the first time about personal attacks that have been aimed at him , including racial slurs and a death threat , during the crisis . <p> " I do n't give a damn , " Tedros said . <p> " I am a very proud black person or negro . I do n't care being called even negro ; I am . <p> " When the whole black community was insulted , when Africa was insulted , then I do n't tolerate , " he said , referring to suggestions last week from two scientists about the continent 's suitability as a vaccine testing ground . <h> Superstar support <p> Late Wednesday he retweeted the personal support he has received from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rwanda . <p> United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres lent his support too , saying it was not the time to criticize the early response to the outbreak . <p> " Now is the time for unity , for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences , " he said in a statement . <p> Tedros can call also on some top-level celebrity backing , such as US superstar Lady Gaga . <p> He has teamed up with the singer to launch a giant online coronavirus awareness concert on April 18 entitled " One World : Together at Home " , featuring music icons like Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder . <p> Tedros said there would be worse to come from Covid-19 if the world did not unite to stand up to its spread . <p> " Let 's fight like hell to suppress and control this virus , " he said . <p> " Otherwise , with the way we are doing now , I think we will regret it .

" I did n't know you could walk around with heart failure .

In New York City , for example , which has faced the most severe outbreak of COVID-19 in the US , some hospital staff were told to reuse N95 masks until they were " soiled " or damaged . <p> Nurses , also in New York , have reported shortages of other Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) , including gowns and were thus advised to use garbage bags to protect themselves and their patients . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday reported having less than a one week supply of goggles , gowns , face shields , N95 masks , and paper medical masks -- all worn to protect healthcare workers and their patients from infectious diseases , like COVID-19 . <p> Nurses at Jefferson continued their close contact with patients like Elaine , though nurses were assigned to a set group of patients , limiting potential exposure as they were " constantly wearing gloves and changing them , " McDevitt said . There was also a moratorium on hugs in the hospital , she said . <p> At Jefferson , doctors no longer came to their patient 's bedside unless it was absolutely necessary . Instead , they stood in the doorway to talk to their patients . On March 25 , McDevitt was told doctors had found a potential organ donor .

" She called Harvard a " politically convenient punching bag " for politicians like President Trump . <p> But she noted that the lines are not clear-cut about which institutions might be deserving , and not , of stimulus funds . While Harvard was certainly due more money than many of its surrounding community colleges , the congressionally approved formula allocates funds for institutions ( as opposed to the money directed to students ) in part to compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential colleges more than commuter institutions . <p> And while Harvard 's endowment may strike many observers as unequivocally too large to warrant receiving taxpayer money , " how far down the endowment list " do you say that ? Palmer said . " That 's why this is more of a political question than a policy question . " <p> An official of a major research university said it was " totally predictable " that the Trump administration would use the current situation for an " attack " on prestigious universities . Every wealthy university would essentially be a " pass-through " for the funds to its financially neediest students , the official said , citing numerous students whose " summer earnings are not going to happen , or whose families ' financial circumstances have changed for the worse .
